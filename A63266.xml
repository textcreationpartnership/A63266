            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE firſt part of this Diſcourſe was written laſt Summer, occaſioned by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Sermon: but ſo many Anſwers to it came forth, and there was ſo much diſcourſe of his Reply long before it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that it was laid aſide, till We might know what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength the Dr. had to bring into the field, which when I had conſidered, I found no reaſon to alter any thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of what was writ before, but only to add ſomething in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a few things ſuggeſted in the Drs. ſecond Book, which therefore I have made a ſecond Part. I muſt beg pardon for ſome Repetitions, eſpecially in the Hiſtorical Parts, the Drs. Diſcourſe inforcing me to them. I do not meddle with the many Queſtions about Church Government and Ceremonies, which the Dr. and his other Opponents have started; my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is only to ſhew the most plain, and the most generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Reaſons of the Non-Conformiſts for their practice in diſſenting from the Liturgy, and in exerciſing their Miniſtry though ejected, and this I do becauſe the Dr. hath endeavoured to repreſent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, eſpecially in the latter of theſe, as acting againſt
<pb facs="tcp:97114:3"/>our own Principles and Conſciences, as if we knew it was Schiſm, but dare not tell the People ſo. Therefore I have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given our Senſe of things, and ſhall leave it to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Readers. What the Dr. hath ſaid against our practice I have conſidered, being unconcerned with all the rest; and if He pleaſe at any time hereafter to give us his Arguments directly to this Question; which he first propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Non-Conformists Preaching to their own People, when forcibly cast out; or to other People that call them in this time of Confuſion and Oppreſſion of the Church be Schiſme or Sinful? I ſay if He ſhall give us his Arguments, which He may do in a few ſheets, they ſhall be examined with as much impartiallity and Candour, as He ſhall pleaſe to write them. In the mean time our Adverſaries may here ſee we have ſome Reaſon for what We do, and our Friends may ſee that we do not own the Principles of Separation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of the Nature and end of a Church, with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Churches.</head>
               <p>THat we may the more diſtinctly ſet forth the Perſons and cauſes of our Diſſent and Separation from them, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to themſelves the name of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as its revenues and preferments, it will be needfull by way of preparative, briefly to conſider, what is the nature and end of the Church? what the ſeveral ſorts of Churches be? what Communion we muſt have with them? and what Separation from them is Lawfull or Unlawfull?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Then for the nature and end of the Church, <hi>It is a ſacred Society, or Common-Wealth, whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the Head, King and Governour, vnited unto him firſt, and then to each other, for theſe two great ends,</hi> viz <hi>to Glorifie God in him, and that they may be ſaved from ſin and Satan, and at laſt glorified with him.</hi> I call it a ſacred Common-Wealth to diſtinguiſh it from all other aſſemblies, civil, or military, or natural, which may, and often and ſignified by the Hebrew, Greek and Latin Names of a Church. The Church is a ſociety or Common-Wealth, <hi>i. e.</hi> ordered and conſiſting of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and governed, not an accidentall, confuſed Congregation of men: Chriſt is the head, King and Governour of this Society; hence it is called his body, and his fullneſs; as a <hi>People</hi> be to their <hi>King,</hi> Eph. 1.24. <hi>His Kingdome, his People,</hi> yea <hi>his Houſe and Temple,</hi> Eph. 2.21.22. And he is alſo cal'd the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, or <hi>King, Prince, Lawgiver, Lord,</hi> &amp;c. As Union is the bond of all ſociety, ſo the Church alſo is an united policy: the Union of ſocieties is voluntary conſent and agreement among themſelves; but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97114:4"/>whereas men in civil ſocieties may firſt unite among themſelves, and then chuſe a common Head or Governour, and unite with him; this ſociety is made up of ſingular Members, of whom each one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly and for himſelf, doth firſt unite with Chriſt, his Head and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, by agreement and conſent, and then ſecondly doth joyn with all thoſe that have, or ſhall ſubject themſelves to the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour: order is good for ends, and orderly ſocieties do combine for proper ends, to be attain'd by ſuch combination; and as thoſe ends are good or bad, ſo is that Corporation of men to be adjudged good or evil. The Church is United for ſacred and holy ends, and therefore it is a ſacred Common-wealth; the proper ends which this combination of Chriſt and his Church reſpect are, that God may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz</hi> immediately and directly in acknowledging him, worſhipping and honouring him, ſeeking his Love, favour and bleſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In thoſe ways and by thoſe means which he the head and Lawgiver ſhall preſcribe: natural and civil ſocieties if combined for honeſt ends, are for the Glory of God, remotely in lower things, but the Church is immediately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in gloryfiing him, and that not as a Creatour only but as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer alſo by Jeſus Chriſt; and as the end of all good ſociety is the good of the community, and of every perſon in it, (as far as can be attained) and not of one part only; ſo the Church is united to Chriſt, and every Member to the Church; for their own ſpiritual good immediately and directly, <hi>viz</hi> that they may be every one everlaſtingly happy in ſerving and enjoying him, which muſt be brought about by recovering them out of the miſery that they are in by ſin, which is their Salvation, and putting them into the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Kingdom of Heaven, which will be their Glorification: civil and natural ſocieties are for civil and natural good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but the Church is a ſpiritual Common-Wealth, for ſpiritual ends only; hence it hath its name in the New Teſtament <gap reason="foreign">

And to whom are they called? to Jeſus Chriſt as their Head and King, to ſerve <hi>him</hi> and be ſubject to <hi>him,</hi> and that not in managing the buſineſs and intereſt of this world, but in obeying and honouring him immediately in order to the world to come, leaving the management of worldly things to other ſocieties, or combinations of men under other Governours and other

And as Chriſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Head of the Church, ſo <hi>he only</hi> gives Laws to it, whereby it ſhall be governed, and by his Spirit procureth and maintaineth love, and obedience to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and to <hi>his Laws.</hi> It followeth alſo that all other Governments and <hi>their</hi> Laws, with the deſigns and ends of them, are extrinſecal to the <hi>Church, as ſuch,</hi> and muſt not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in the ſpiritual peculiar ends and government thereof: they may joyn their perſons to the Church, by giving up themſelves to Chriſt, the King thereof, for the Spiritual ends of <hi>his</hi> Kingdom, but they may not mix, or interweave the intereſt and ends of <hi>their</hi> Kingdoms or governments, with thoſe of Chriſts in <hi>his</hi> Church; for ſo it would become a Kingdom of <hi>this world,</hi> and the concerns of this world would greatly hinder, if not ſwallow up thoſe of the World to come, which the Church is deſigned for. Moreover the Church conſiſts of Members called indifferently out of all Nations, Kindreds, Sexes, Ages, diverſities of worldly intereſts, through the ſucceſſion of all Generations from the beginning to the end of the World, whereof one part is in Heaven already, the Church of the firſt born which are written in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. (for they yet wait for the coming up of their Brethren, till when, they do not receive the compleat benefit of their aſſociation, and union to Chriſt, and each other) the other part is yet on Earth purſuing the ſame general deſign of <hi>their</hi> Common-Wealth, the Glory of their King and their own Happineſs; yea among theſe, ſome are yet Infaunts and Children, capable only of the immediate influence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and protection of their Heavenly King without being able to do any thing for themſelves; and others there are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, who, though they are not actuall Members of this ſociety, yet are known to the King of it, and their names contained in his Role, and he will not reckon his Kingdom compleat, or the ends of it accompliſhed, till theſe alſo are brought into it, even to the laſt man: (<hi>John</hi> 10.16.) what then are the Intreſts and deſigns of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97114:5"/>world? or the Princes of this world? or the Laws, Methods and Inſtruments by which they purſue thoſe deſigns, to this Kingdom of Chriſt? <hi>they</hi> are diverſe in every age; <hi>this</hi> is one throughout all ages <hi>they</hi> are contrary to; and do ſubvert each other, and one ſucceeds another; <hi>this</hi> is one uniform, moſt conſiſtant government; <hi>they</hi> are temporary but for the preſent, for the ſhort lives of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, or for the uncertain continuance of their Families, and then they paſs to others, perhaps their enemies; but <hi>the dominion of Chriſt is an everlaſting dominion, and his Kingdom an overlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> Dan. 2.24.</p>
               <p>Thus we have the true definition of the Church of Chriſt, which is but one in Heaven and Earth, diſperſed throughout all Countreys, and Ages, from the beginning to the end of the world, Ruled by his Laws contained in the Scripture, influenced by his Spirit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe Laws, and protected by his power againſt all their enemies: to this we muſt reduce all Diſcourſes and Notions of a Church, and examine them by it, as by the firſt truth in that kind, the Rule and ſtandard of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Wee are next to conſider the diſtributions, or ſeveral ſorts of Churches.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, the Church is diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Triumphant</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant,</hi> as a whole into integral parts; the <hi>Church Triumphant</hi> is that part of the Church of Chriſt which is already in Heaven, having got the victory over ſin and Satan, yet not fully Triumphant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it waits for deliverance from Death, or the Redemption of the Body; the <hi>Church Militant</hi> is that other part which is yet on Earth conteſting with all her Spiritual Enemies; both theſe make up the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which we profeſs in the <hi>Creed,</hi> and is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſubject to Chriſt, and immediately govern'd by his Word and Spirit, and all the Members of it as Members of this Church are equal, none having authority over others, being all equally and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately united to Chriſt, and guided by <hi>him</hi> to the proper ends of this Society.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Church Militant is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal or Catholick</hi> on earth, <hi>ſc.</hi> all the Chriſtian Members of the Catholick Church, that live on Earth, diſperſed through all Countreys, mixed with all ſocieties of Civil Government; with whom alſo are mixed many perſons, who profeſs Chriſt, but are not really united to him by conſent, and real ſubjection of the heart, and therefore are not living Members of the Church, but accidental acceſſions to it; as Forreigners that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97114:5"/>live in any ſtate or Common-Wealth, in ſome general things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their Laws, ſeem to be Members of <hi>that</hi> Society, but indeed have their Relation and Union to another: Or elſe this Church is <hi>particular,</hi> as 'tis diſtributed into ſeveral leſſer ſocieties, for their convenience and edification; now <hi>theſe</hi> are not diſtinct Churches, but diſtinct Conſiderations of the Church on Earth, either as collectively conſidered, as one Company united by the ſame Bond to Chriſt the Governour of all, though divided and diſperſed in place; or diſtributively in reſpect of place only, being divided into ſeveral leſſer Companies; theſe alſo thus conſidered, have all an equall Relation to Chriſt, as their Governour; to his Law, as their Rule: to his Spirit, as there Internal Living Guide; and to each other, as Brethren without any authority over each other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Theſe particular Churches, if they be conſidered only in reſpect of place and vicinity, may be, and are by ſome, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into <hi>National,</hi> viz all the Chriſtians that live in one Nation, or under one conſtitution, or form of civil government; or <hi>provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, viz</hi> the Chriſtians that live in one Province or County; or <hi>City Churches,</hi> thoſe that live in one City or <hi>Pariſh Churches, viz</hi> the Chriſtians that live in a leſſer Neighbourhood: yea thus Churches may be diſtinguiſhed or divided into as many ſorts as there be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of men, any way divided or diſtinguiſhed from each other: but all theſe diviſions are but accidentall, and extrinſecall differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſeveral parts of the ſame Church, thus divided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe leſſer parts, which are all equally Churches, and that upon no other account then their Relation to Chriſt, and to the univerſal Common-Wealth to which he is Head. From hence we infer 3 things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All particular Churches being but integral, homogenious or equal parts of the Catholick Church, they have all an equal intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power of forming themſelves into Congregations or leſſer bodies, for their own ſpiritual edification, according to the Laws which Chriſt hath preſcribed to that purpoſe; for being all Brethren, equally and immediately related to Chriſt, and the diviſion betwixt them being meerly accidental and external, (from the place of their dwelling, or other circumſtances,) they muſt all have an equal right to all the ordinances and priviledges of a Church, and equal authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſpoſe of themſelves for their own good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the only end of Chriſtians combining into ſeveral leſſer ſocieties is, that they may ſerve Chriſt together, and help each
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97114:6"/>other in their Spiritual concerns; for they are a ſpiritual Common-Wealth aſſociated for Spiritual ends only, when they are conſidered as one body under Chriſt; therefore if they divide themſelves into leſſer bodies, it muſt be only that they may more eaſily and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently attain the ends of the Whole Body, and generall Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that the deſigns of civil governours, Laws and intereſt, with the conveniances of civil bodies, greater or ſmaller, ought to have no influence or concern upon the conſtitution of theſe particular Churches; for if they imbody themſelves in leſſer companies, only to ſerve Chriſt, and edify each other with the beſt advantage to their Souls, then they are ſtill in ſuch incorporating only to reſpect the honour of Chriſt, their own edification, and the beſt execution of Chriſts Laws among them, leaving other governours to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ends of <hi>their</hi> Laws and Government, in ways proper to themſelves and diſtinct from theirs; and therefore if civil Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours model theſe Churches in ſubſerviency to <hi>their</hi> civil ends, they do really alter the nature of Churches, and take them out of their immediate ſubordination to Chriſt, and his Spiritual Government; or elſe they make Chriſt and his Government and Common-Wealth ſubſervient to theirs, and the concerns of Mens Souls, to be not other ways regarded then as they may promote worldly and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary deſigns.</p>
               <p>But further, that part of the Church which is on earth, being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from their King and Lord, and in a ſtate of imperfection, hath therefore need of guides and helps, that it may underſtand the Law of Chriſt, and yield obedience to it; though all are equally Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, yet all are not able to guide and help themſelves; from whence ariſeth the neceſſity of Guides and Governours in the Church; whence it is called an <hi>Organical Church,</hi> as a body conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of different organs, for different uſes; thus the Church is made up of governours and governed; but 'tis ſtill the ſame Church under the ſame Head Chriſt, and his word as its Law; only the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and application of this Law of Chriſt, is committed to ſome for the better edification of all, <hi>viz</hi> the preſerving and perfecting thoſe that are preſent Members, and the continuing of the Church by bringing in more that ſhall be ſaved, Church Governours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are in no wiſe <hi>ſupream,</hi> Chriſt being ſtill the immediate head, both of power and influence, both to make Laws and to make them effectual upon the hearts of men; <hi>they</hi> are appointed only to expound
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97114:6"/>and apply Chriſts Laws for the good of his People, for his Glory only, and to leave both the ſucceſs and the account to Chriſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and of the people.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſeth a Fourth Diviſion of the Church, in reſpect of the Government and order of it, into Oecumenical, National, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, Dioceſan, Claſſical, Parochial or Congregational, but all theſe and each one alike, are taken in a double ſence, ſingularly or collectively; ſingularly for one individual Church or Body under one Government, whether of one or more perſons, and thus the <hi>Oecumenical or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> on Earth, muſt be but one great body of Chriſtians aſſociated with the ſame Governours, for the edification of each other; as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old being one Family, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed into a People, and theſe gathered into a great Aſſembly at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was there framed into one ſpiritual ſociety, under the Guidance and Government of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> ſo that when they were afterwards diſperſed over all <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were yet but one polity, and accordingly thrice a year at leaſt, all met to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God together, to teſtify their Unity, this the Pope claimeth, <hi>viz,</hi> that the whole Church is one Congregation committed to him, as the only Paſtour or Head of all. In like manner a <hi>National Church</hi> thus ſingularly underſtood, is all the Chriſtians of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion making up but one Congregation and Polity, all immediately under the ſame Governour.</p>
               <p>Alſo the <hi>Provincial Church</hi> is all the Chriſtians of one Province: the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> of one Dioceſs, or ſmall circuit; and the <hi>Parochial or Congregational,</hi> the Chriſtians of one ſmall Neighbour-hood, or that without reſpect of Neighbour-hood, voluntarily gather into one ſmall Aſſembly under the ſame Guides or Governours reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. The Church collectively taken; if <hi>Oecumenical</hi> is the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of all Churches in all Nations under one general Head and Government; the <hi>National Church</hi> is made by the Union of all the Churches of ſeveral leſſer Diviſions, under the general National Officers; the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> is all the Churches of a Dioceſs or ſmaller circuit, as the <hi>Provincial</hi> is thoſe of a larger circuit, under one Common Head or Biſhop. A <hi>Claſſis</hi> is the ſame thing with a <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> ſaving that by common uſe the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> is appropriated to one Head or Biſhop, and a <hi>Claſſis</hi> to thoſe Churches that are govern'd by the common Conſent and Councell of the Miniſters of the ſeveral Congregations. And a <hi>Parochiall or Congregationall Church</hi> is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of ſo many Chriſtians, as living in one Neighbour-hood, or in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97114:7"/>ſome convenient nearneſs may ordinarily meet together for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God and all other offices of a Church.</p>
               <p>Here we muſt obſerve, that if the Church be taken for one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Congregation, immediately under the ſame Governours, then.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Oecumenical Church was never inſtituted by Chriſt,</hi> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gathered them into one Congregation, as he did <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor ever appointed one Governour or Colledge of Governours over them. For ſeeing the Church was to be called, and gathered out of all Nations, and that ſucceſſively, ſome at one time and in one place, and ſome at another, one Colledge of Governours (much leſs one ſingle perſon) could not take charge of it, to teach it or rule it; nor could Chriſtians ſo diſperſed perform the duty of Fellow Members to each other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor did Chriſt ever conſtitute a National or Provincial Church;</hi> Henever called a Nation or Province at one time to the Profeſſion of his Goſpel, nor can one perſon or ſociety of Governours teach ſuch a body, or adminiſter the Sacraments to them, or know their caſes; nor can the people know and help one another, or come to their Governours upon every neceſſary occaſion, eſpecially not in times of perſecution, which for the moſt part hath been the lot of the Chriſtian Church; and ſhould ſuch a thing be neceſſary our Bondage would be greater, and means of edification much leſs, then they were to the Jews, who were confin'd to a little countrey, and were an intire people among themſelves, and all tyed to each other by the Bonds of nature, as one great Family deſcending naturally from one man and woman.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Nor did Chriſt inſtitute Dioceſan Churches,</hi> viz, <hi>that all the Chriſtians in ſome conſiderable circuit (leſs then a Nation or great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,) ſhould be one Congregation, ruled by one or more Governours im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</hi> There were no ſuch companies or aſſociations of men called, converted, or formed into Churches, by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; but the firſt Believers were ſcattered and independent perſons, called as God pleaſed; beſides ſuch a flock cannot ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily meet together, know and help each other, or repair to their Governours, or be acquainted with them as they ought; nor can the Governours know, teach and feed <hi>them,</hi> and when we have once exceeded the bounds of a regular aſſembly, to make up one Church of many Towns, of a whole County, or more, we may by the ſame reaſon extend it without end, to a whole Province, a whole
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97114:7"/>Nation, or Empire; and ſo make the duties of Paſtours and People impoſſible; and the ends of the Church impoſſible to be attained, which is contrary to the nature of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A Parochial or Congregational Church, is the only Organical Church; directly and immediately appointed by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For thus the Apoſtles collected the Believers in every City and place where they had preached, into one Church or Society, ordaining them Elders in every Church; <hi>Acts</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. If theſe Churches were companies of Believers in ſeveral Cities and Towns, as the Hiſtory in the 13 <hi>and</hi> 14 <hi>Chap.</hi> ſhews, and the Apoſtles ordained them Elders in every Church, then they did conſtitute them ſeveral Congregations, and no common Governours over them all; nor have we any command to do ſo, when the Churches ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed into multitudes of Members. It muſt be remembred that the whole Church in Heaven and Earth is one Common-wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its Union to Chriſt, and the ſame general end of that Union; in like manner every particular Church being but a part of the whole, muſt unite only to attain the ſpecial ends of the whole Church, with more eaſe and convenience, and therefore they muſt be no more then the ſame Governours may exerciſe a true paſtoral care over, and as may perform the Offices of Brethren ordinarily to each other; and alſo may aſſemble together in one place ordinarily for the worſhip of God, and their mutual edification. To what purpoſe is the name of a Church, or Society, to ſerve Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and edify each other, when the perſons are ſo numerous, or ſo diſtant that they cannot poſſibly perform theſe offices? ſuch combinations are uſeleſs, yea burthens and ſnares. Even our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites confeſs this, <hi>viz,</hi> that the firſt Churches, and thoſe for 200 years after Chriſt at leaſt, were but ſeveral Congregations, which when the number of Chriſtians were multiplyed, they ſay were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Dioceſſes; be it ſo, yet what warrant had they to keep the Chriſtians of one city or place to <hi>one</hi> Congregation, and <hi>one</hi> Paſtour perſonall or collective, when the number was ſo increaſed, that the ends of that ſociety could not be attained? 'tis the beſt conſtruction we can make of the proceedings of thoſe antient Churches in this eaſe, that out of deſire to keep up the unity of thoſe Congregations which the Apoſtles planted in great Cities, they ſtill obliged all that were afterwards converted in thoſe Cities, to be Members of the ſame Congregation, and then the converts in the Villages about; And laſtly, all the Chriſtians that were within the civil juriſdiction
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97114:8"/>of thoſe Cities, whether it was leſſer or greater, provinces or whole Countreys, till they made government impoſſible to themſelves, and to the edification of the People, and made way at laſt for Primates, Patriarks and the Pope, and turned the ſpiritual government of Chriſt by his Miniſters and Word into a civil government of their own, maintaining what they had gotten by their own Cannons, and the Laws of Princes; and why muſt we not take warning by them? now if the Churches appointed by Chriſt are only the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch Chriſtians that can ordinarily meet together, and with their Paſtours, for the proper ends of a Church, it follows that they muſt judge for themſelves, what Congregation, and how large or ſmall is for their own edification; it is their own choice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that makes them Members of the Catholick Church, and this Congregation is but a part of that, to proſecute the ſame ends, therefore it is their buſineſs and concern to frame their own ſociety; alſo theſe Congregations have the ſole right of chuſing their own Paſtours, admitting their own Members, and altogether of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves; elſe they have not the power of a Church, but are a company of Chriſtians ſubject by right or wrong to thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe this power over and amongſt them; it alſo follows, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations cannot be juſtly compelled to combine or unite into lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger aſſociations, (as Dioceſſes, Provinces, Nations, or the like) for the ends of civil governours; for this alters the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of a Church, and is a great diſhonour to Chriſt, that he muſt not Reign among his people but as men pleaſe; but if ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations do aſſociate for mutual help and ſtrength, into ſmaller or greater Congregations (as Claſſes, Dioceſſes, Provinces, or even all that are of one Nation) yet they muſt unite, but as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cities of <hi>Achajah,</hi> or at preſent the United Netherlands for great and common caſes, and for generall defence, leaving the ſelf preſerving and governing power intire to every Congregation, and they alſo are to be judges, how far 'tis for the good and edification of the Church to inlarge or contract ſuch aſſociations, how long to continue them, and when to break them off; for thoſe aſſociated aſſemblies govern only by aſſent, and have not other authority over particular Congregations farther then as they approve of it; we may illuſtrate this by the civil governments of the world. There was at firſt but one Family, and but a ſmall one, all mankind was made of one blood, to dwell on all the face of the Earth; <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. was there any obligation when they were multiplyed, that they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97114:8"/>ſhould ſtill continue in one Family: or was it conſiſtent with the ends of Family Government? other Families had the ſame intire autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity within themſelves, as the firſt had, and authority to ſever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the firſt, when <hi>that</hi> was too numerous, and <hi>they</hi> a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number to make diſtinct families: again when families were multiplyed, were they obliged to live all in one Country? and to continue in one civil ſociety? what then muſt have become of all the other parts of the earth, which they were commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh and poſſeſs; <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. Surely <hi>one</hi> company or a certain number of Families, had full authority to remove and plant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies where <hi>they</hi> pleaſed, as well as another; yea we ſee God compelled them to it by confounding their Languages at <hi>Babel;</hi> and farther, when one colonie removed into another Country, were they bound ſtill to adhere to thoſe they departed from, as a part of their ſociety: if ſo then all Nations muſt ſtill have been parts of that ſociety, from which they firſt deſcended, and ſo at length the whole world muſt have been but one Common-wealth, under one Government, which was impoſſible and would overthrow all the ends of government; if then the race of mankind, which are one body in ſome ſence more then the Church is, <hi>viz,</hi> linked by the indiſſoluble Bond of Nature, (whereas the Church is united by free conſent,) I ſay if <hi>they</hi> having the general gift of the earth and all that is in it to poſſeſs, have free liberty and authority to ſhare the world amongſt them, to conſtitute various ſocieties greater or ſmaller as they pleaſe, for the end of civil Life, (provided they wrong not one another, and ſo hinder the ends of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) why may not the Church, though it is one body, as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, it being too great to live in one ſociety, multiply it ſelf into ſo many, as are for it's own edification, and the ends it was made for? and not be obliged ſtill to adhere as parts, to thoſe firſt Congregations that were planted in every country, as it were the firſt Families, till they are a burthen to themſelves, till their very ſociety makes them a diſorderly confuſed multitude, and their government degenerates into Anarchy, eſpecially when we have neither command or Scripture example to the contrary?</p>
               <p>By this we may Anſwer the <hi>Dr</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>viz,</hi> What neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there is to reduce Churches to ſeveral Pariſhes or Congregations, any more then to reduce Kingdoms to the ſeveral Families of which they were at firſt made up?</p>
               <p>Anſw. Becauſe Congregations have an original right of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97114:9"/>and preſerving <hi>themſelves,</hi> even as Families have a natural and unalterable right of government within <hi>themſelves,</hi> which <hi>he</hi> that takes from them, makes them ſlaves and deprives them of their Birth-right; he himſelf ſaith upon the diſſolution of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the Nations that before compoſed it, reſumed their antient rights, and formed themſelves into ſeveral Kingdoms and Common-wealths, yea and as he would have it into National Churches alſo: grant this; have Nations ſuch an immutable right to their civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and government, that they may lawfully reſume them, when they have opportunity without the guilt of Rebellion? why then may not Pariſhes reſume <hi>their</hi> right of government within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for their own edification, when they have opportunity or neceſſity calls them to it? alſo wanting the benefit of protection and government from them that undertake them? why ſhould this be <hi>Schiſm</hi> in them, more then <hi>Rebellion</hi> in the other? and that ſelf Government is the right of euery Pariſh or Congregation, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, when he ſaith that <hi>antiently a Church and Dioceſs was all one, under one Biſhop and a company of Preſbyters, for thoſe did officiate in common among the whole people, and when by reaſon of Multitude they began to divide them into ſeveral companies for meeting together at the ordinary times of worſhip, nevertheleſs they all met together at the ſame Sacrament, and all made uſe of the ſame Miniſters as occaſion ſerved, they being not tyed to any one, or any one to them,</hi> ſo that this Dioceſs was but a great Pariſh or Congregation, and if the original right of Government were in theſe, it is ſo ſtill in our leſſer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and to reſume this right is no ſinfull ſeparation: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs we deny not, but the Congregations may and ought to unite for their mutual help and defence, eſpecially in times of peace; even as civil ſtates combine for mutual defence and commerce; but then this muſt be voluntary, and not to impoſe a yoak on the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Congregations, by taking away their ſeveral liberties, or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all to the ſame Liturgies or Ceremonies, for this is all one as if confederate Nations or States, muſt therefore oblige each other to the ſame form of Government, and the ſame rights and cuſtoms of living; and why may not all the Pariſhes in one County with us, combine for their mutuall help and edification, in certain times of meeting each other, by their Miniſters or Delegates, yet every one reſerving to themſelves the Government of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own cuſtoms and uſages, according as they find moſt meet for themſelves? as well as the ſame County have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97114:9"/>their Quarter-Seſſions for civil Affairs, wherein the Governours and Countrey concerned have a generall meeting, and yet every Town hath its own ſupreme Officers with ſeveral rites and cuſtome, without any Breach of Peace or Good Neighbour-hood among them?</p>

               <p>WE are in the next place to conſider, what Communion the Church is obliged to, betwixt the ſeverall parts of it? and what Separation is contrary to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? and what is not?</p>
               <p>For the Firſt; The Church is a ſacred Common-wealth united to Chriſt, now the end of every Common-wealth or Polity is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good that they all promote the good and welfare of that Body, and every Member of it, of which they are parts, <hi>viz,</hi> that particular good in thoſe particular caſes, and things for which they did combine together: this is meant by Communion: for hereby all the actions and deſigns of that body are common, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the good of all: the Communion then of the Church which is aſſociated only for ſpiritual ends, conſiſts in this, that <hi>all</hi> deſign and endeavour the common good and welfare of all Chriſtians in general, and of themſelves in particular, in furthering the Salvation of their Souls, the ſervice of Chriſt, in the uſe of thoſe helps or means which Chriſt hath appointed to theſe ends: this Communion hath diverſe degrees and doth exerciſe it ſelf ſeveral ways, according to the ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the Church, and the Relations Chriſtians have to each other, more General or Remote, or more particular and near:</p>
               <p>The Communion therefore of the Catholick Church in Heaven and Earth is, that they all hold the ſame Head Jeſus Chriſt, and own each other as Brethren in him, that they love each other, and all purſue and wait for that univerſal perfection which they ſhall all have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97114:10"/>when they are all gathered to Chriſt at the laſt day: This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion cannot be broken without renouncing the Head, and his Religion, and love to each other, which are the Rule and Bonds of this Union; and therefore there can be no Separation from the Catholick Church but what is not only ſinfull but damnable; as he that renounceth the common bonds of humane ſociety, (juſtice, love and all moral honeſty,) and only pleaſeth himſelf, without regarding the good of any other, he doth hereby break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of mankind, and becomes unfit to live among them: the two great parts of the Catholick Church, that in Heaven and this on Earth, have a Communion, in that they are both United to Chriſt; <hi>both</hi> worſhip and ſerve him, in thoſe particular ways that are proper for the ſtate they are in; and <hi>both</hi> wait for that compleat Salvation, which they ſhall have at their general meeting: beſides this, we know of no Communion betwixt them, <hi>viz,</hi> that either part can be ſerviceable to each other at preſent, only we that live on earth enjoy the benefit of the Prayers and Examples, which <hi>they</hi> left us <hi>who</hi> are now in Heaven, and of their endeavours to continue the Goſpel to us; and ſo we ſucceed them in the ſame offices, and endeavour to tranſmit the Knowledge of Chriſt, his Goſpel and Ordinances to thoſe that ſhall ſucceed <hi>us,</hi> nor can <hi>here</hi> be any Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of one of theſe parts from another, without breaking of Chriſtian Religion, which is impoſſible to them that are in Heaven, and if any on earth thus ſeparate it is to their own damnation: The Catholick Militant Church on Earth hath a Communion in ſome more particulars; for beſides their common acknowledgement of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, and the common love they are to bear to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on earth, as their Brethren; they are to perform all offices of love, which in this their imperfect militant ſtate, they are able and may need from one another; ſuch as to pray for all, to rejoyce in each others welfare, to ſympathize in each others afflictions, to aſſiſt by councell, charitable relief, hoſpitallity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when ever there is occaſion, to receive each other to their worſhip, as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, leaving to every one the liberty of their particular rites or opinions; and this is ſo indiſpenſable a duty, that no Separation can be lawfull or tolerable, in thoſe who ſeparate from the Catholick Church, who relinquiſh the profeſſion of Chriſt, or caſt of all love to their Brethren, or that will not joyn with them in the worſhip of God, or concern themſelves in their common concerns:</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97114:10"/>of their Religion and their edification under Government o Paſtours and Guides, <hi>their</hi> Communion muſt be, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of every ſuch Church joyn with each other ordinarily and peaceably in the ſame Acts of Worſhip, and perform all offices of love to each other in ſome tolerable meaſure; that they be ſubject to their Governours, and that their Governours do conſcionably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the edification of the people committed to their charge, according to the Laws of Chriſt which are the general rules of theſe ſocieties, and according to any other particular rules which they ſhall agree on amongſt themſelves, for their own edification, as Circumſtances may require; and ſo that both parts, Governours and Governed do joyntly promote the edification of the whole Body in Holineſs and Peace: Separation therefore from theſe Organized Churches is a Breach of this Political Communion, and Order among themſelves; which is done either by breaking off from the Body to which they belonged as Members, (which is Separation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called,) or by diſturbing the Communion of it, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from ſome parts or acts of that Communion, though they do not wholly break off from the body: ſuch Seperation is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes Lawfull, in ſome neceſſary, and a duty, and therefore muſt not be Univerſally Condemned, but the cauſes of it be inquired into: For though all Chriſtians muſt be Members of Chriſt, and of the Catholick Church under him, for the general ends of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it doth not appear yet that they muſt be Members of the ſame Organized Society, or that they may not upon juſt occaſions leave thoſe ſocieties they were joyned with, and go to others already in being, or conſtitute new ones for their own edification; even as in civil government, men may not only compoſe divers Polities or Common-Wealths, but may alſo make new confederacies, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Polities into leſſer, and particular perſons may depart from <hi>them</hi> to others, or conſtitute new ones, yea may deny their concurrence with many things done in the ſociety they joyn with, and all this without the Crime of Sedition or defection, till the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ends of ſuch practiſe prove it ſo.</p>
               <p>Now to deſcend to the particular forms of Organized Churches: by what hath been ſaid we may eaſily judge of their Communion, and Separation from them:</p>
               <p>And Firſt, For the Oecumenicall Church, the Political Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>thereof</hi> muſt be, that all Chriſtians in the World be ſubject to the ſame Governours under Chriſt, and live as Members of the ſame
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97114:11"/>individual ſociety, either as a ſingle Congregation, or as of many united into one: Separation from <hi>this</hi> Communion muſt therefore be either to interrupt the peace and order of this Communion, or wholly to forbear joyning with them; but ſuch a Catholick unity of the Church under one Government being impracticable, and inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the edification of the Church, ſince it is inlarged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed throughout the world, it is needleſs to diſpute about Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it, or Separation from it:</p>
               <p>All other Churches that exceed the bounds of a ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and muſt be conſtituted of many, are of the ſame nature with the Oecumenicall Church, though not of the ſame latitude, as to the matter of Communion; which muſt therefore conſiſt in the performance of all offices mutually betwixt Governours and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Members of the ſame ſociety, whether it conſiſts of ſeveral Nations, as Patriarchial Churches, or of the people of one Nation, as National Churches, or of the people of one Province, one Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, or Claſſis, as Provincial Dioceſan, or Claſſical Churches: Separation here muſt be either a diſturbing of the peace and order of theſe Churches, or a withdrawing from them as to the political duties due to them; ſuch Separation muſt often be lawfull and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, ſeeing no command of Chriſts binds men to particular Provinces or Dioceſſes, nor always to continue in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Finally, The Communion of a Pariſh or Congregation conſiſts in this, that Paſtours and People mutually perform their reſpective duties to each other, and amongſt themſelves for their dayly edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Separation from ſuch Congregations is either to interrupt their Government or Concord, or to withdraw from them: now ſeeing no man is immutably bound to one Congregation, nor any Congregation to one Dioceſs, or any larger combination, and all theſe Churches are ſubject to corruptions, which the Members muſt oppoſe and contend againſt, ſeparation from them muſt not be cenſured till it be known whether the cauſe be juſt or unjuſt.</p>
               <p>And thus we are come at the laſt to enquire, What are juſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Separation? whereby we may judge alſo what are not. And that we may not ſpeak too generally and confuſedly, we diſtinguiſh betwixt Separation of one Church from another, and of particular Members from that Church whereto they did belong. As all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are bound to Communion among themſelves, being all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church of Chriſt, though gathered into ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler bodies for their own conveniency; and this Communion conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97114:11"/>in acknowledging each other as Brethren, in performing bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly offices of Love and Kindneſs, and eſpecially in admitting each other to their worſhip upon occaſions; ſo Sepetation betwixt Churches is a Breach of this Communion, when one Church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owneth another to be a Church of Chriſt, excludes them from her Ordinances, and from all Offices of Chriſtian Love: This is juſt when 'tis upon great and juſt cauſes, (ſuch whereupon we refuſe Communion with the Papiſts and Socinians) if upon lighter cauſes it is Unlawfull, and a great breach of Charity, yet not to be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated as an unpardonable ſin, or as that which deſerves more animadverſion then thoſe ſins which deſtroy all Religion and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, ſeeing men may be good Chriſtians in Doctrine and practiſe, good Subjects and good Neighbours, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a miſtaken opinion concerning another Church: but this is not the Separation I ſhall inſiſt on; the cauſes that make this juſt, will make the other juſt alſo; but all the cauſes that make Separation from a particular Congregation juſt, will not reach our Comunion with other Churches, or concern our Separation from <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall therefore enquire, for what cauſes Members of a Church may Lawfully ſeparate from it, <hi>i. e.</hi> contend for the reformation of the Church, and if they cannot attain it, withdraw from, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joyn to other Churches, or make new ones themſelves? And to clear this point, let us always Remember, that the Church is a Common-Wealth United to Chriſt as the Head Firſt, and but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily to each other; Faith and Obedience to God in Chriſt, with the Salvation of their own Souls, is the end why men become Chriſtians, and give up themſelves to Chriſt; and next they give up themſelves to the Church, as a Society that profeſs to deſign the ſame end, and to have given up themſelves to the ſame Lord, and therefore they hope, and intend by the Friendſhip of this Church to be aſſiſted and furthered towards the attaining of their great ends; if therefore the Church prove otherwiſe <hi>i. e.</hi> to be no help but an hindrance to their ſerving of Chriſt, and furthering their Salvation, Separation from it, is not contrary to their Obligation as Chriſtians, they are ſtill Members of Chriſt, yea may and ought to ſeek ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Society, wherein they may attain thoſe great ends; it is true men are bound to bear with many things amiſs in a Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there will be always ſome things amiſs in one kind or other; and alſo for publick peace, leaſt by unſeaſonable reforming ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97114:12"/>leſſer things amiſs, or withdrawing from the Church, while there is any reaſonable hope of amendment, they ſhould make things worſe; yet when they cannot worſhip Chriſt aright, or can have no tolerable edification in the Church, the end of the Church Society is deſtroyed, and Separation from it become neceſſary; and the peace of a Church is ſubordinate to the great end of a Church, <hi>viz,</hi> that Religion may be preſerved and promoted among them; but when this is not intended, but betrayed, peace then is no duty but a conſpiracy againſt Chriſt, and the good of his Church: Even as in civil Government, the end being the good of the whole Society, ſo long as that end is tollerably purſued, in the preſervation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick juſtice and honeſty, many things muſt be born with, rather then to endanger the whole by unſeaſonable endeavours to mend leſſer things; but when the publick good is not minded, or thoſe conditions broken, upon which men did aſſociate, and there is no hope of redreſs, in this caſe peace and quietneſs is to betray the Government: The cauſes therefore which make Seperation Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are, in generall, when men cannot worſhip Chriſt aright, in the chief parts of his worſhip, or edify their own Souls in the Church, whereto they are joyned, and when there is no reaſonable hope of the redreſs of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Particular cauſes are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When a Church is idolatrous:</hi> for now it forſakes Chriſt the Head, for whoſe ſake and ſervice we became Members of the Church, and therefore muſt now forſake it for him; <hi>what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>Ye are the Temple of the Living God,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 17. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When any known ſin is made the condition of Communion,</hi> i. e. <hi>when a man ſhall not be admitted or continued to be a Member of the Church, unleſs he approve ſome errour in Doctrine, corruption in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or himſelf commit ſome ſin in practiſe, or at leaſt conſent to it in the Church:</hi> For alſo this deſtroys the end of a Church, which is to edify us in Faith and Obedience, whereas here ſomething againſt Faith or Obedience is to be the very entrance into the Church.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe 2 caſes all agree, that Separation is Lawfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and they both hold ſtrongly againſt the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for ſhe is manifeſtly idolatrous, and impoſes both Falſe Doctrines, Superſtitious Worſhip, and wicked practiſes upon all her Members:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97114:12"/>nor will it ſerve to ſay, that <hi>that</hi> Church denies <hi>her</hi> worſhip to be idolatrous, or the Terms of her Communion to be ſinfull; but ſhe muſt clearly prove it from Scripture, which is the Law of a Church, and that to the capacity of every Chriſtian concerned: for if there be any reaſonable grounds to ſuſpect the Terms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Unlawfull, a Chriſtian cannot with ſafe Conſcience ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them till he is ſatisfied to the contrary; and the Church having no Authority from Chriſt to impoſe any doubtfull, much leſs ſinfull Terms of Communion, in this caſe the Church is guilty of the breach, and not thoſe who refuſe to joyn with her, or withdraw from her.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When there is no tolerable means of edification in the Church, though no evil is impoſed upon the Members.</hi> As when the teachers are Hereticall in the chief points that concern our Salvation; or ſo contentious, and ſuch railers at any that differ from them, that they cannot be heard with peace and compoſure. For this cauſe the Dutch, both Miniſters and People, and the then Prince of Orange alſo forſook their Pariſhes, becauſe their Arminian Preachers ſpent ſo much time railing on the Calviniſts, that they could neither hear them with profit, nor bear them with Patience. Alſo when Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are groſly ignorant, and unable to explain the neceſſary Doctrines of Salvation to the People; or when they do not, or will not ordinarily preach to them, or endeavour their inſtruction; or when their Lives are greatly contrary to Religion and Godlineſs; or when the People are almoſt all corrupt in Doctrines or wicked manners, and will not be reformed. For all theſe caſes are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the ends of a Church, and we muſt rather forſake the Church that we may be edified in Faith and Holyneſs elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, then foregoe our Edification to keep Peace with the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dr</hi> hints at general Inconveniences that will follow, if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple find Fault with their Governours, and withdraw from them; and to ſuch inconveniences all things in this world are ſubject, and there ought to be the greater care to prevent them; but muſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bear always? ſtill there is nothing left but the name of a Church, and their Communion with that be a hindrance to their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt? beſides, nothing would more awe both Paſtours and People to their duty, then if they knew that the ſobereſt and moſt carefull Chriſtians of their own Salvation would leave their company, if they would not mend their manners; and this would
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97114:13"/>be a more Univerſal Benefit to the Church, then the inconvenience of now and then one unſeaſonably withdrawing out of prejudice or finding too much Fault, can do hurt to any Congregation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>When a Church hath neither the exerciſe nor power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The Catholick Church is a Society under the Government of Chriſt by his Spirit, and every particular Church is a part of the Chatholick, gathered into a Politicall Body, that it may edify and preſerve it ſelf, which is done by Government and the exerciſe of Diſcipline, as well as by preaching the word and adminiſtring the Sacraments; and indeed the latter will be as ineffectual without the former, as a <hi>Charge</hi> at an <hi>Aſſize</hi> or Seſſions, wherein the Laws are recited, would be, if there were neither <hi>preſentment</hi> nor <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of Offenders: A Church without Power of Government is no Church, but a Company of Neighbours that meet ſometimes to hear the Word, and receive the Sacraments together, which Members of ſeveral Congregations may do: for power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the form of a Church, as of a Civil Polity, by which only it differeth from a confuſed, accidental conventing or cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of perſons: now it is no ſin to ſeparate from that which is no Church but a Duty; as much as it is for every one to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſome viſible Church: This caſe is too common with <hi>us,</hi> where Miniſters of Pariſhes are ſometimes Deacons, at leaſt for a while, who have no Miniſterial power at all; and if Presbyters, yet ſuch as pretend to no more then to preach and adminiſter the Sacraments; all power of Government, as they ſay, belonging to the Biſhop; and whatever their private Judgment may be of their power of Government; we know, they neither do, nor dare, exerciſe any ſolemn admonitions, or ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, much leſs Excommunication or Abſolution; when this is the caſe that the Church hath no power to govern her ſelf, hath long loſt it. and is out of hopes to recover it, nothing can oblige men to live Members of it, though there may be reaſons why we ſhould hear and receive with them occaſionally, as with Brethren: If it be ſaid that the Biſhop hath a power of Government over all his Dioceſs, I anſwer, this ſhuts out all the Pariſh Miniſters from Government, and makes <hi>them</hi> but the Biſhops Curates, and makes all the Pariſhes ceaſe to be diſtinct Churches, and to become one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Church under a Biſhop, who is utterly uncapable to manage the charge of ſuch a Congregation; be it only to govern and not to preach, as ſome men would have it; and ſo it is ſtill deſtructive
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97114:13"/>of the end of a Church, <hi>viz,</hi> ſelf-edification and preſervation; but moreover the Biſhop himſelf is ſubject to the Metropolitane, and all cauſes in his Dioceſs admit of an appeal to the Arch-Biſhops Court; ſo that neither hath the Biſhop ſupream and full power of Governing <hi>his</hi> Church; and therefore neither is the Dioceſs a Church, but a part of the whole province, all under the Government of the Arch-Biſhop alone, the Biſhops being but his Deputies; and this ſtill makes the Government more impoſſible, and Separation more neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A 5th. juſt eauſe of Separation is, when men are certainly and conſtantly debarred of ſome Principal Ordinances of Chriſt neceſſary to their Edification and Communion with Chriſt.</hi> The end of a Church is the joynt practice of all the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt, in their proper ſeaſons. It is poſſible there may not be occaſion for the exerciſe of ſome of them (as Church Cenſures) for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time; and it is poſſible ſome Ordinances may be careleſly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, or for ſome reaſons, for a time omitted; (as the Lords Supper) This is no cauſe of withdrawing, at leaſt not properly; but if there be conſtant Bars put, that any of theſe Ordinances ſhall be excluded the Church, (as the Sacraments are with many Sectaries:) or that they ſhall be made unacceſſable by ſinfull or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary additions, alterations, interpolations, or any other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; ſo that the moſt conſcientious Chriſtians cannot Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in them, this after a convenient waiting and ſeeking for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs will juſtify Separation: for the people may not be contented with one part of the Worſhip of God, and the means of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; this is to betray the Goſpel and their own Souls: nor have Church Governours power to add any thing, either eſſential or circumſtantial to the Ordinances of Chriſt, that may hinder the people from Communicating in them; and if they have no ſuch authority to enjoyn ſuch things, there is no obligation upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, either to comply with them in obedience, or to bear their uſurpation, by continuing in Union with them. If it be pleaded that the <hi>Jews</hi> never ſeparated from their Church, when they could not Communicate in the Sacrifices at the Temple, under Idolatrous Kings, or when the Paſſover or other Ordinances were wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected or little uſed: I anſwer, this is not the caſe of Chriſtian Churches: the <hi>Jews</hi> were one ſingle, though large Congregation, inſtituted by <hi>Moſes</hi> to continue till Chriſt ſhould come, who ſhould have power to new moddle the Church, as he ſhould think fit: <hi>they</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97114:14"/>were all tyed to one Altar, and one Temple, and might Sacrifice no where elſe; <hi>they</hi> were alſo obliged to one Prieſthood, the Houſe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and therefore in what-place-ſoever they were, they muſt hold Communion with this people and Prieſthood at this Altar; and if publick worſhip was neglected or corrupted, they could in no caſe ſeparate, or gather New Congregations, or chuſe new Prieſts, or build new Altars, but muſt be content with private helps, till things were reformed: but Chriſtians though of one Nation or City, are not obliged to one Congregation indiſpenſably. (for then men may not move to other Pariſhes,) nor to one place of publick worſhip, nor to one Miniſter or company of Miniſters; the Chriſtians Church, being tyed to no Countrey, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; nor to any particular people nor kindred, nor having any promiſe to be continued to the end, in any one place, or amongſt any one people; it hath therefore power to diſtribute it ſelf into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Congregations, and conſequently again to withdraw from any one of them, when there is need.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Groſs infringement of Chriſtian Liberty;</hi> we are commanded <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. To <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty with which Chriſt hath made us free, and not to be intangled again in the Yoke of Bondage;</hi> this was Liberty from the Ceremonial Law, which being diſſolved by Chriſt, the Church might ſuffer no man to impoſe on them again; conſequently the Church was freed from all Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but thoſe which Chriſt had appointed in his Goſpel, and ſhe muſt maintain this Liberty; now if the Governours of the Church, either by themſelves alone, or with one part of the people, will impoſe Rites and Ceremonies on the Church againſt the conſent of the whole, or part of the People, without ſhewing ſufficient reaſon for ſuch impoſition, or any neceſſity from preſent urgent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for ſuch Rites and Cuſtoms; this is a great uſurpation, and the people are deprived of the Liberty Chriſt purchaſed for them, and bequeathed to them as a ſingular priviledge, and therefore it doth greatly obſtruct edification, the end of a Church. Now though every ſuch impoſition will not warrant ſeparation preſently, yet when they are multiplyed and inforced with Rigour, it overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Peace of a Church, and ſo their edification; and alſo tends to enſlave the people to their Rulers, and to open a Door for all the Rites and Ceremonies that Superſtition or Tyranny can invent and therefore this is to be timely withſtood: enſlaving the people, deſtroys the end of Church Government, and therefore frees men from a neceſſary Obligation to that Government.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97114:14"/>
               <p>To theſe cauſes of Separation, which are the principal and moſt weighty, we may add, that <hi>when Pariſhes are grown ſo populous, that no one place will hold them, to hear the word and receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments together, that they cannot know each other generally, much leſs perform the mutual offices of Fellow Members, they may Lawfully divide themſelves into more Congregations;</hi> and if it can be done with general conſent, it is moſt for peace; but if not, men are not bound to hazard their Souls to gratify the Pride of others, who had rather Thouſands ſhould periſh Eternally for want of the neceſſary means of Inſtruction, then their Dominion be leſſened. This we ſee ſometimes done by the civil Magiſtrate, <hi>viz,</hi> large Pariſhes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and if he will not do it when there is need, the want of his concurrence cannot make it a Schiſm for the people to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the moſt ordinary and obvious cauſes of Separation from Churches, and which will be moſt uſefull for the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. It is true, <hi>Church Governours</hi> are as unwilling the people ſhould have any liberty without <hi>them,</hi> to provide for the edification of their Souls, as <hi>Secular Powers</hi> are jealous of ſuch a claim in <hi>their</hi> Subjects; and they tell us, as this <hi>Dr</hi> doth, what confuſion it leads to, if the people ſhould be judges of their Miniſters, Doctrines or Lives, or of the commands of their Governours; if they may in every caſe, and according to their own fancies withdraw from them; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here they fight with a Shadow; no judicious man ever affirmed that the people may according to their fancies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, ſuſpitions or light ſcruples withdraw from their Churches; but what then? muſt they withdraw in no caſe? they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſt, and not to their Miniſters, any further then as they diſpenſe the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt; ſome inconveniencies will <hi>ſometimes</hi> happen upon juſt ſeparation, it may be <hi>always,</hi> as there is no publick change in any ſtate, though from worſe to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but it is attended with ſome inconveniencies for a time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to particular perſons; but if it be for the laſting good of the whole, thoſe inconveniences muſt be over-looked.</p>
               <p>It was this Notion of not withdrawing from Churches and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, almoſt upon any account, that ſuffred ſo many errors, corruptions, and uſurpations to grow upon the antient Church, till at laſt they were all formed into the body of Popery: for good men in thoſe days complained of multitudes of Ceremonies, pride and ignorance of Church Governours, and ſuch like growing evils;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97114:15"/>but for fear of being accounted Novations or Donatiſts, and out of an overweaning reverence of the Church, they were afraid to make any effectual oppoſition againſt them; and the ſame notion ſet's very fair to produce the ſame effect again: we grant they muſt be very weighty caſes that warrant Separation, and ſuch as do directly and neceſſarily overthrow the edificaion of a Church: we grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that people muſt wait a convenient time, and uſe all peaceable means for reformation, with all due reſpect and reverence of their Governours; but if after all, no reformation can be had, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt not hazard the Salvation of their own Souls, and the honour of Chriſt, to pleaſe men; and the greateſt inconvenience that is like to follow upon ſuch Separations is, that it is like to make Church Governours more diligent in feeding the Flock, and more cautious of impoſing upon them, and of ruling them with Rigour; it will alſo make the people more carefull of their practiſes, leaſt they often offend their Brethren by their Scandals, and cauſe them to avoid them for diſorderly walking; but what if the people, having great offences and ſtumbling blocks laid in the way, and great obſtructions of their edification, and inſtead of any Redreſs have <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Anſwer, that more Burthens ſhall be added, or <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Compaſſion, that it is want of more ſeverity in Laws and Government that makes people cry out for Indulgence and Relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? what if in ſuch caſes, the people ſometimes withdraw from a Church, either in part or wholly, ſooner then in ſtrictneſs they ſhould, or then the wiſeſt men, who can bear longeſt, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? yet if this be really done for the edification of their Souls, that they may enjoy the Ordinances with more profit and peace, and they do not un-church thoſe they withdraw from, or refuſe to own them as Brethren, or to hold Brotherly Communion with them on juſt occaſions; certainly this can be accounted but an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity incident to the generallity of men: for all have not patience or prudence alike, nor do all underſtand the rules of Government and Societies; yet all ſerious Chriſtians have ſo much ſence and prudence as to love their own Souls, and to feel when they want Spiritual Food themſelves, and to pity and love all their true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Brethren; and if God approved the defection of the Ten-Tribes from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and forbad him to endeavour to reduce them by violence, though they offended in the manner of their withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he will not certainly condemn thoſe, who conſcientiouſly withdraw from thoſe Churhes where they cannot have edification,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97114:15"/>or Chriſtian Liberty, though they may fail in ſome circumſtances of their withdrawing.</p>
               <p>And how <hi>they</hi> will Anſwer it, who would have <hi>them</hi> reduced by the Sword, and giving them over to the Devil, when in the mean time they will remove none of their ſtumbling blocks, themſelves caſt in their way, let <hi>them</hi> ſeriouſly conſider.</p>

               <p>Of the Firſt in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>When Pious K. <hi>Edw. 6th,</hi> by the advice of the Council and ſome Biſhops, about the Year of our Lord 1549 and 1550, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Popery, and inſtituted a new Liturgy, as a form of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, Adminiſtration of Sacraments, with other Rites and Ceremonies, as alſo of ordaining Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons in and for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> immediately many good and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, eſpecially ſuch as had Travelled in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> among the Firſt reformed Churches, were diſſatisfied with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97114:16"/>this Model of reformation as imperfect and ſhort of what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures required, and moſt other reformed Churches had attained to, and alſo as ſymbolizing too much with <hi>Rome,</hi> in the manner of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers, in Ceremonies and Church Government: they glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced the good beginnings of reformation, and heartily joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the endeavour of cleanſing God's Houſe; but they were ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the work ſtopped almoſt in the beginning, and that ſome out of ignorance of the Truth and too much reſpect to the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in which they were bred, did ſtrive to recede from it as little as might be, with whom others joyned, ſome for fear of Tumults, thinking they had gone as far as the people at that time would bear; others for reaſons of State, being willing to keep the publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government of the Church, as much as might be, under the command of the Civil Magiſtrate; and ſome as it fares in all caſes, being <hi>Popiſh</hi> in Heart, yet ſeemingly joyned with the Reformers in framing their Liturgy, only that they might undermine and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in making a through reformation.</p>
               <p>The number of theſe who were diſſatisfied with the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, dayly increaſed as the Proteſtants multiplyed; ſo that in Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> Reign, but ſeven years after, there was a number of theſe at <hi>Franckford</hi> only, enough to make up a Congregation, and to have Miniſters of their own, and to keep publick Aſſemblies in a Church allowed them by the Magiſtrates; who thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be now at their own Liberty, laid aſide the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and compoſed a new ſhort one for themſelves, after the manner of other reformed Churches. In the Reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Diſſenters increaſed, and were called <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> and <hi>Puritans;</hi> and now the Eccleſiaſtical State began to take notice of them, to remove ſome of them from their preferments and imployments, and to encenſe the Civil Magiſtrate againſt them; nevertheleſs they increaſed in number and reverence with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Divinity-Profeſſours of both Univerſities, and many others eminent for piety and learning were then reckoned <hi>Puritanes,</hi> and ſome ſuffered as ſuch.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> ſhewed <hi>himſelf</hi> more diſpleaſed with them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have Rooted them out of the Church; yet in his time 750 Miniſters ſubſcribed a Petition to him for reformation of things yet amiſs in the Church. In his Sons Reign, the Papiſts, who were now got to Court, and had both Favour and Power, joyned <hi>their</hi> intereſts with the Biſhops to Root out theſe Non-conformiſts, as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97114:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>thoſe that were moſt contrary to them, ſeeing they diſliked the Biſhops and their Liturgy for coming ſo near to <hi>them;</hi> and how many worthy Miniſters and thouſands of the beſt people were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into Forreign Countries, and thoſe that ſtayed at home were ſeverely treated for the ſpace of 16 years; and yet like <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the more they were oppreſſed the more they increaſed. Nor have their numbers been diminiſhed, or their cauſe diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ever ſince, notwithſtanding the great endeavours to caſt <hi>odium</hi> upon the one, and ſuppreſs the other. <hi>Dr Fuller</hi> wittily ſums up this Hiſtory thus, <hi>Non-conformity was conceived and bred in King</hi> Edward s <hi>Day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, it was born at</hi> Franckford <hi>in the Reign of Q.</hi> Mary; <hi>under Q.</hi> Elizabeth <hi>it was in its Child-hood; in K.</hi> James <hi>s time it grew to be a good tall ſtripling, and under</hi> Charles 1ſt. <hi>it grew to be ſo ſtrong a man as to unhorſe its oppoſite prelacy, and to get into the Saddle.</hi> thus He and I add, that <hi>the turning ont of</hi> 2000 <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts out of the Miniſtry and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities in</hi> 1662 <hi>was no argument, that this man was paſt his full Strength, or declining to deerepid age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſons of the diſſent of ſo many for ſerveral Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have been principally theſe.</p>
               <p>Rea. 1. The Firſt taken from their diſſatisfactions with, and objections againſt the Liturgy: they diſallow not a Liturgy, or Directory rather, <hi>viz,</hi> a preſcribed order and rule for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of publick worſhip, in which all might agree, and generally conform to prevent confuſion; yea, and to ſatisfy their Epiſcopal Brethren, they could be content with a ſhort Liturgy, preſcribing the Form of Prayer and Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and other publick offices; provided, nothing but an queſtionable doctrine and duty, and neceſſary order, might be thruſt into it; and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, eſpecially after they come to ſome years and experience, might be left to uſe it at their diſcretion; ſo that the Liturgy may be a Rule of Concord, a Teſtimony of the conſent and agreement of the Churches, in Doctrine and Worſhip, and a Guide to young men entring into the Miniſtry, but not a Snare to any; much leſs to hinder the exerciſe of the gifts of the Spirit, which are given to the Miniſtry on purpoſe to edify the Church with, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſuch as theſe are the Liturgies of moſt reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and to this purpoſe only. But againſt our Liturgy they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it obliged all Miniſters, without limitation all the days of their lives, to the ſame form of words, in all publick worſhip,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97114:17"/>whether it would ſuit with the condition of the people, or the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of providence, or not; alſo that it was ſo large as that it did moſtly prevent the uſe of Miniſters own Gifts, or made them ſeem but ſuperfluous additions; this they conceived to be directly contrary to the inſtitution and office of the Miniſtry, which was appointed by Chriſt, and furniſhed by him with his Spirit, that they might to the worlds end adminiſter all his Ordinances to his Church, <hi>viva voce,</hi> as the Spirit ſhould give every man ability, and particularly fit him for the people he was to take charge of: they are indeed by their office obliged to the Holy Scriptures, the words as well as ſenſe, as being the divinely inſpired Law of the Church, which they are to interpret and apply; but ſeeing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and application of the Scriptures is their work, and every ordinance doth imply this more or leſs, they ought not to be tyed generally and ſtrictly to certain forms of words wherein to expreſs themſelves, unleſs they were of divine inſpiration; and if all that Miniſters were to ſay to the people, was preſcribed them, as it might be in all, as well as in thoſe things wherein the Liturgy doth preſcribe to them, then the Miniſtry might be a calling as others are, that men might in a common way take up to read all divine ſervice, but certainly there would need no ſolemn ordination or conſecration to this office with Faſting, Prayer and impoſition of hands, more then to any other calling.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They object againſt our Liturgy, that the matter of it and words alſo are generally taken out of the Service Books of <hi>Rome, viz,</hi> the <hi>Maſs-book, &amp; Ceremoniale, &amp; Pontificale Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> and that the form of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the manner and order of the ſervice is too much conformed to, yea little different from the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Maſs or Service: now they ſay God in the Law refuſed to be ſerved with any of the Forms, Modes, Ceremonies, Cuſtoms, Veſſels or Utenſils wherewith Idols had been ſerved; yea though the things were ſome indifferent Rites and Cuſtoms, and which the idolatrous thought founded upon reaſon and nature, and the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were of Materials of <hi>his</hi> own making. It is true, what is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from Scripture muſt be uſed though it was abuſed by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; whatſoever is founded-upon divine inſtitution comes from the word, not from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but to keep to their Words, Order, Method, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeems too great reſpect to that Church, and that ſervice: They knew very well, there was no legal pollution upon the Words or Ceremonies, becauſe they had
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97114:17"/>been uſed by the Papiſts, as there was upon the Idols Utenſils un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, wherefore they might not be converted to mens pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uſe, but muſt be deſtroyed; but to tranſlate their ſervice into our Church in things wherein we have the ſame liberty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing forms and methods for our ſelves, as any others have, this ſeems too great a reſpect to that idolatrous Church, from whence they came, too eaſy a paſſing by all the Pollutions and Tyranny, with which they had defiled and tormented the Church of Chriſt; too great an acknowledgement of her, as a worthy or eminent Church, from whom we ſhould take a pattern of our worſhip; all which were certainly diſpleaſing to God; and by this ſymbolizing with <hi>Rome</hi> in our worſhip, we harden the Papiſts, as if we differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them but in circumſtantial things; we keep in mind there ways and worſhip, and ſo continually expoſe the people to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of returning to Popery; and alſo reflect upon the reformed Churches, chuſing <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>our</hi> Pattern, keeping ſo near to <hi>her,</hi> whereas <hi>they</hi> have all utterly caſt her of, and compoſed new forms of worſhip for themſelves, out of the Scripture: nor can there be any other reaſon given, why <hi>England</hi> above all other reformed Churches, is ſo much ſollicited to, and in danger of relapſing into Popery; from age to age, but that her publick ſervice and Church Government is ſo much like to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Papiſts think they may eaſily perſwade us to receive <hi>all</hi> the reſt, ſeeing we are ſo zealous to retain <hi>ſo much</hi> of their Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They thought our Liturgy very defective in the publick Prayers; partly in that there are very few things mentioned in them, and thoſe very generally; either in the confeſſions of ſinsor petitions for Mercies, eſpecially Spiritual; and the Letany, which is ſomething more large and particular, (yet comes not near the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wants of mens Souls,) mentioneth things ſo briefly, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly paſſeth over to others of a different nature, that there is no time for mens thoughts to reflect on them, or their Hearts to be affected with them, which is one ſpecial end of Prayer; and partly becauſe of the abrupt breaking off, and dividing one Petition from another into ſeveral Prayers; moſt of the Collects containing but one ſingle Petition, or two at moſt; this breaks off intention and affection: neither is there any order among the Prayers, or cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Petitions, and ſome Petitions are repeated often in the ſame ſervice; yea ſome whole Prayers; eſpecially when the Letany is read, there is a very needleſs repetition of almoſt all the Prayers;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97114:18"/>for if that be comprehenſive of all neceſſary things, what need other Prayers be uſed at that time? theſe defects <hi>viz</hi> confuſedneſs, inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, tautologies in words or ſence, going backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are objected as intolerable in the Prayers of particular Miniſters, who yet may out-grow ſuch weakneſs and pray with better method, and to better edification; they are not then to be excuſed in the Church Liturgy, where no man hath power to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, or alter any thing, and Rulers are very unwilling to yield to amendments, for fear of confeſſing ſomething to have been amiſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They were not ſatisfied with the Reſponſes, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould audibly ſpeak after the Miniſter, or alternately with him; this leſſeneth the gravity and ſeriouſneſs of the Service; hindreth the exerciſe of Thoughts and Affections in the people; and makes the worſhip more like a Dramatick Action, (wherein every one acts their part and muſt wait for their <hi>Q.,</hi> or time of ſpeaking and ſilence,) rather then like the ſolemn ſervice of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They diſlike the frequent repetitions of the Lord's Prayer, which in every Morning and Evening ſervice is twice uſed, and once for every office that is added to them; as when the Letany is read or the Communion Service, or a woman Churched, or a Child Baptized, or a Marriage Solemnized, or a Perſon buryed; ſo that it is not unuſual to rehearſe the Lords Prayer five or ſix times before the Liturgy ſervice be finiſhed; and yet the Miniſter muſt uſe it in the Pulpit after all. They could not conceive any reaſon or excuſe to be given for this cuſtome; but a ſuperſtitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of that form of words, almoſt turning them into the Nature of a Charm; as if they could not be uſed too often, and the very uſe of them made all other ſervice the more acceptable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The corrupt Tranſlations of the Scripture uſed in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: that there may and ever will be imperſections in, and doubts about Tranſlation of Scripture, whilſt mens Knowledge is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and their Judgments diverſe, is granted by all, but the Tranſlations in the Liturgy in the Pſalms, Epiſtles and Goſpels are groſly corrupt, ſome contrary to the ſence of the Text, and in ſome places whole Verſes omitted, and the Titles of all Pſalms are left out, which in the Hebrew are the firſt verſe of the Pſalms, and very neceſſary for the underſtanding of them: therefore to oblige men to read theſe Tranſlations only in the Church Service, even when we have a better, and publickly authorized Tranſlation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97114:18"/>they judg'd it a matter of no ſmall Offence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Reading of the Apochryphal Scriptures as parts of the publick worſhip, and that without any diſtinction from the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical: They accounted it an intolerable thing, that Fables and Fictions ſhould be ſolemnly Read to the People, with the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence as the Word of God; and ſuch are many of the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books; and the reſt being only of Humane Authority, the reading of them ought not to be made a Solemn part of Divine Worſhip. The Conformiſts ſay that Reading the Scripture is Preaching, and the Non-conformiſts ſay, it is not fit, meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Fabulous writings ſhould be preached to God's People, when they meet to Worſhip him by hearing <hi>his</hi> word. Above all they were offended that a great deal of the Holy Scriptures is left out of the Liturgy, and ſo never to be Read in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Apocryphal Chapters put in their Room.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Holy-days or Feſtivals in the honour of Saints. They would not deny, but if the Church thought fit, they might obſerve the days of Our Saviours Nativity, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion and ſending the Holy Ghoſt, as other Proteſtant Churches do; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they might be kept ſeriouſly, and not made of the ſame neceſſity with the Sabbath; but when all divine worſhip of the Creatures is Idolatrous, and the keeping of days in Honour of them, as well as Building Temples to them, was ever reckoned a part of Divine Honour (and to be ſure is more Honour then ever God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or allowed to any of his Servants,) They knew not how to excuſe this practice, that it ſhould be a part of a Churches Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Nor could they approve the Doctrines of the certain Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of all in Baptiſm, and that Infants dying after Baptiſm before the Commiſſion of actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved; which are laid down in the Liturgies, as undoubted Articles of Faith; whereas there is no Scripture that clearly proveth either of them; and at beſt they are points diſputed on by Learned men on both ſides. Nor could they excuſe the practice of refuſing Parents to promiſe for their own Children in Baptiſm, ſeeing it is upon <hi>their</hi> Account only, and Gods Covenant with <hi>them,</hi> that the Children are admitted to be Baptized; and they are thereby engaged to breed them up in Faith and Obedience; much leſs that <hi>Strangers</hi> ſhould receive the charge of the Baptized, <hi>who</hi> have no authority over them, <hi>who</hi> neither care what they promiſe, nor are ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97114:19"/>to account, how they perform their promiſe, for if they ſhould, few would undertake the charge, and ſo this cuſtom would fall to the ground.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They excepted againſt the Ordination of Deacons to read Divine Service, Baptize and Bury, and to preach with ſpecial Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe; this they ſay was to create a new fort of office in the Church, which Chriſt never appointed, nor gave his Miniſters Authority to appoint it: Deacons were to look after the poor, and that was all their work; and though the Primitive Chriſtians ſometimes uſed them to read the Scriptures in the Congregation, yet they never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them to this, as an office; yea though they ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to read Prayers, to Marry or Bury, yet this is no ſacred office appointed by Chriſt, that ſhould conſtitute a diſtinct order of Miniſters; and if, as grave and prudent perſons, they might be admitted to do theſe offices, either for want of Miniſters or to aſſiſt them; yet may they by no means be ſuffered to Baptize, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as peculiar to the Miniſtry, as to adminiſter the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and the admiſſion of Members into the Church, as ſacred and ſolemn a work, as to confirm and Build up the Members of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the principal objections of the Non-conformiſts againſt the Liturgy, which were, ſome of them at leaſt, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified and confirmed by many particulars, of leſſer moment in themſelves, but all tending to make their deſire of a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Service Book to ſeem reaſonable, and the work neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea.</hi> 2. The Second thing the Old Non-conformiſts diſliked in the Church of <hi>England</hi> was, the Government of it by Prelates, <hi>i. e.</hi> Biſhops, with ſole power of Juriſdiction. Many of the Old Non-conformiſts thought Epiſcopacy utterly unlawfull, and an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation not to be born; but the reſt, who looking upon it as a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſtitution (as our Law doth) thought it Lawfull, and that it might be ſubmitted to, did yet diſlike <hi>our</hi> Epiſcopacy; partly becauſe of the ſecular grandure, power, and imployments our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were inveſted with; which made them unable and unwilling to diſcharge the office of a Paſtour in the Church, partly becauſe the Church hath nothing to do in their election, except an empty ſhew, and therefore perſons were moſt commonly prefer'd not for true Epiſcopal Qualifications, but becauſe they could make intereſt with Superiours, but principally becauſe the Biſhops arrogated to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97114:19"/>themſelves the whole power of governing the Church, and excluded all the Miniſters from any ſhare therein, a thing moſt unexcuſable in them, who acknowledge themſelves to be of the ſame order with the Presbyters, and only in a degree of honour above them, and that by the Authority of the Civil Magiſtrate. Whereas even thoſe that with any probability or ſobriety maintain the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, do nevertheleſs acknowledge that he may neither or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, nor govern without the advice and conſent of his Presbyters. This was look'd upon as intollerable, that the power of governing the Church which was committed by Chriſt to all his Miniſters, ſhould be wreſted from them generally by a few of their Brethren. And that they who are thought fit to diſpenſe the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>the cheif keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, whereby men are brought to the Faith, admitted into the Church and bnilt up in it,</hi> ſhould not have power to cenſure offenders, and to receive the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent again to Communion; which are things of leſſer moment and depending on the former, and yet without which, the former could not be managed in a fit manner for Edification. By this means Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are deprived of one half of their Office and Power; and are both diſcouraged and hindered in the other half For who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their Preaching, who have not Liberty to judge what perſons are fit to be admitted into the Church, or who in it deſerves cenſure, or to be caſt out of it. And the Biſhops themſelves in undertaking the whole work of Governing the Church, took that upon them which they never could, nor did manage for the Churches Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>R. 3d. The Non-Conformiſts, were much diſſatisfied about the Diſcipline of the Church, both in reſpect of the Rule of it, and the Officers that manage it. The Rule they ſay is not taken out of the Scripture, which is the only Rule and Law of Chriſt's Church; but it is the Roman Civil and Canon Law, which at beſt were ſuited to their own times, and People, in many things very defective, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, erroneous and ſuperſtitious.</p>
               <p>There were indeed ſome appointed by K. <hi>Edward,</hi> to collect a body of good and uſeful Rules out of the Canon Law, to be the Rule of Diſcipline for this Church, but he dying that work was never fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſo that the Rule now is the whole Canon-Law, or ſo much as every Biſhop pleaſeth to uſe in his own Dioceſs. The Biſhops made a few Canons of their own 1603. but they are ſuch as only ſtrengthen their own power in impoſing and enforcing thoſe things,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97114:20"/>which the Non-Conformiſts had long deſired might be amended. As to the Officers that Adminiſter the Diſcipline, They are Chancellors, and Commiſſaries and Civilians by Profeſſion; no Eccleſiaſtical Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, yet theſe Rule over the Miniſters of Chriſt, Admoniſh, Suſpend, Deprive them of their places, and Excommunicate both them and the People when they pleaſe. This they have no power to do, nor can the Biſhop delegate his pewer of Governing to them any more, then his power to Preach the Word, and Adminiſter the Sacraments both being parts of the Miniſterial Office: This they thought was to change the Conſtitution of Chriſts Church at pleaſure. They were alſo offended at the Adminiſtration or uſe of the Diſcipline, (That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as the Officers were) becauſe the Church in its Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and frame kept ſo near the Roman model. Therefore the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have ever found it neceſſary to exerciſe Church Diſcipline moſtly againſt thoſe that diſliked or diſſented from the Liturgy, and Government, and to connive at the looſe and prophane, to hold them in ſome external obedience to them: Hence it came to paſs, where one Miniſter hath been admoniſhed, ſuſpended, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived for Hereſie in Doctrine, or Un-godlineſs of Life, ten have been ſo dealt with for Non-Conformity; and where one of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been cenſured for ſcandalous ſins, an hundred have been troubled and puniſhed for going to hear a good Miniſter out of their own Pariſh, when they had an ignorant drunkard at home, for not having their Children Croſſed in Baptiſm, for ſcrupling to kneel at the Sacrament, and ſuch other great Crimes againſt the Liturgy. What was this but to alienate the Church of Chriſt to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and to make it to ſerve them more then him, and only to uſe his Name and Authority to preſs their own Laws, and maintain their own power.</p>
               <p>R. 4. They were diſſatisfied at the Ceremonies impoſed in the Liturgy. In the general they acknowledge, that it was lawful for any Church to conſent to, and lay upon her ſelf neceſſary Rites and Cuſtoms, ſuch as Circumſtances of time, and place, and other emergencies might make neceſſary for the preſent time; but that ſuch Ceremonies ſhould be ſuch whoſe neceſſity was apparent to all, and whoſe lawfulneſs might be ſcrupled juſtly by none of common underſtanding, and that ſhould be taken up by the general Conſent of the People as well as commanded by Rulers, as the Feaſt of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> was by the Jews, <hi>Eſther</hi> 9.23.27. And thoſe neceſſary things enjoyned, <hi>Acts</hi> 15, 23.25.28. And that when the neceſſity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97114:20"/>ceaſeth, thoſe Cuſtomes ſhould ceaſe alſo. But they thought it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawful to deviſe Rites or Ceremonies for which there was neither apparent neceſſity, nor uſefulneſs, or to impoſe thoſe upon the people, which from the beginning were doubtful and offenſive, eſpecially to make them parts of Divine Worſhip, or additions to it, as it were to render it more edifying; beyond the natural and common Civil circumſtances of Order, Method, or Decorum, and ſuch they thought it manifeſt our impoſed Ceremonies were, which are declared to be retained, ſome, becauſe they ſerved for decent order in the Church (for which they were at firſt deviſed) others for edification.<note place="margin">Pref. to the Common Prayer Book.</note> And again that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers were content with thoſe Ceremonies which do ſerve to a decent order, and Godly Diſcipline, and ſuch as be apt to ſtir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to God by ſome notable and ſpecial ſignification, whereby he might be edified.</p>
               <p>Three Ceremonies were at firſt impoſed. The Croſs in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. The Surplice in Reading the Service. And Kneeling in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lords Supper. Againſt theſe they excepted ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Againſt the Croſſe, that it was abuſed to great ſuperſtition and Idolatry in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and particularly when it was uſed in Baptiſm, having Divine power aſcribed to it, of driving away the Devils, giving grace, &amp;c. Therefore being neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, nor uſed in this manner in the primitive Church, <hi>viz.</hi> To admit Members into the Church by it, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>Alſo that it did reflect very diſhonourably on Baptiſm it ſelf, as if that were not full and plain enough to ſet forth the blood of Chriſt, and Remiſſion of ſins by it, or our engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Chriſt, and therefore it was needful to adde a more plain and direct ſign of his death, and ſuffering for us, and of what we muſt be willing to ſuffer for him, above all that the Croſs was made, and here uſed as a Sacrament, being declared to be a token of the Childrens owning the Faith of Chriſt, Obedience to him, and perſeverance to the end: Is not this the nature and end of Receiving Baptiſm it ſelf? Why is not that ſufficient, but the Croſs is preſently added without any note of diſtinction, as it were to ſignifie the ſame things more plainly and fully, and to lay a greater obligation on the Child, then what was laid on it in Baptiſm, and this is a Sacrament as much as man can make. Indeed it wanteth the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97114:21"/>promiſe of Divine Grace, but this alſo is preſumed upon, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this ſeems cheifly to be intended in thoſe words <hi>[of ſome of the Ceremonies being apt to ſtir up the dull mind of man to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his duty, by ſome notable and ſpecial ſignification where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hemight be edified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Againſt the Surplice they object, that was a Ceremony on purpoſe deviſed to add decency and ſplendour to the Worſhip of God, and therefore it muſt be uſed in that Worſhip only, and ſuch Ceremonies are unlawful additions to Gods Worſhip. And thoſe circumſtances or accidents of the Service in their abſolute na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet relatively, in as much as they better the Worſhip and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Edification, they are made moral parts of Worſhip, even as it was a part of Worſhip for the Preiſts of old to put on their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred veſtments to ſacrifice in, though the veſtments themſelves abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and naturally conſidered were but circumſtances of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Alſo that the Surplice ſeemed to be taken from the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial-Law, and to be at leaſt an imitation of thoſe Preiſts Garments. As many other Ceremonies uſed in the ancient Church, were either taken from the Jews, or deviſed to imitate and be like them. Now our Saviour having aboliſhed the old Ceremonies gave no leave to his Church to deviſe new ones, neither did he aboliſh them, as Types and Shadows of himſelf only, but alſo as Yokes and Burthens, as carnal Ordinances and ſervile Cuſtoms, wherein his People were kept in great Bondage till his coming in the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>John</hi> 1.17. Therefore eſuch Ceremonies were utterly unneceſſary ſince the full diſcovery of the Goſpel, yea, they diſparage the Goſpel, as if that was not plain and ſufficiently apt to teach Faith or Holineſs without their help. And beſides they take off mens minds from the Worſhip of God, partly by pleaſing their eyes, and fancies, with an external ſhew, and partly by buſying their thoughts about the meaning of them, and how to improve them, if they be ſerious in the uſe of them: They alſo bring the People again into bondage, and fill the Church with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances and beggarly inſtitutions, and men are ſenſibly taught to content themſelves with outward forms and modes of Service, and to think God is content with them alſo; and further the uſe of the Surplice in Divine Service, kept up too much reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Miniſters and the Prieſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ignorant might be tempted to think there was very little difference betwixt our Church and <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing we came ſo near them in their Service,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97114:21"/>and in the manner and circumſtances of the Service alſo. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they accounted it not unlawful to have continued the uſe of the Surplice till the People were weaned from it, and accordingly many did uſe it, it being not in it ſelf unlawful, as the uſe of the Croſſe was.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Againſt Kneeling at the Lords Supper, they pleaded that it ſhould by no means have been retained in our Church being brought into the Church at firſt, only upon the opinion of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and worſhiping the Sacrament, and very apt to continue the ſame opinion in the People: It is alſo certain our Saviour neither uſed, nor appointed that geſture, nor gave his Church Authority to enjoyn any other, then what he uſed, as a ſtanding precept, for thereby, he, and his practice ſhould be taxed as not uſing the moſt fit geſture, nor is this geſture at all proper to this Ordinance, but thwarteth the two main ends of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Free Communion with Chriſt in the participation of his benefits; and the Renewing of Love, and Strengthning Communion among the People, for it is a geſture of great awe, reverence, and diſtance, not fit for Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the promiſes, or conſideration of the death of Chriſt, or the incomprehenſible love that he manifeſted theerein. Alſo by Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People were ſevered from each other, and could not be at the Table many together, very unlike to a feaſt of Love, nay, the preſence of many would be an hindrance, and not a furtherance of Affection and Devotion. Both theſe inconveniencies were greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, when the People were forced to come up to the Table at the upper end of the Chancel, and there to kneel before the rails a few at a time (for they muſt come to but one ſide of the Table) for this was much more unlike a Supper of Love betwixt Chriſt and his Spouſe, and betwixt fellow Members of the ſame body; yet they accounted not this geſture in it ſelf unlawful, but that they who would might uſe it and it might be retained in the Church, till the People could freely leave it off, but that it was unfit to be impoſed and purpoſely kept up, much more to be enforced with the higheſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty upon thoſe that were diſſatisfied with it.</p>
               <p>The Non-conformiſts were much ſtrengthened in their diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with the Eſtabliſhed Church way, becauſe inſtead of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any redreſs and reformation, all the impoſitions were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and things made worſe, and the impoſers went backward, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then forward, notwithſtanding the Non-conformiſts increaſed in number both in Miniſters and People, and at length became a very
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97114:22"/>conſiderable part of the Church, whoſe complaints ought therefore to have been conſidered and redreſſed. There is a paſſage in the <hi>20th Aritic.</hi> to be ſubſcribed by all Miniſters, <hi>that the Church hath power in matters of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Non-Conformiſts diſliked unleſs more explained: Therefore the Parliament in the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which eſtabliſhed thoſe Articles by Law cauſed that paſſage to be left out. Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> confeſſeth that it was not to be found in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Articles of that year,<note place="margin">B. <hi>Laud's</hi> Speech in the Star Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> 
                  <hi>viz</hi> 1570 yet the Biſhop continued the paſſage in the Articles, and required ſubſcription to it. Alſo that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ennacted that if any Miniſter was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into our Church, having other Ordination than what was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongſt us, he ſhould declare his Aſſent, and ſubſcribe to all the Articles of Religion which only concern the Confeſſion of the True Chriſtian Faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>13</hi> Eliz. Cap. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> and the Doctrine of the Sacraments. By this they gave indulgence to thoſe that were not ſatisfied with the Epiſcopal Ordination, and could not ſubſcribe to the 39 <hi>Artic.</hi> abſolutely, becauſe the approbation of the <hi>Homilies</hi> and Book of Conſecration with the fore-mentioned paſſage were included in them, being content that they ſubſcribed to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Artic.</hi> 35.36.</note> and of the Sacraments contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Articles, but the Biſhops would not allow this indulgence, at leaſt not long, nor generally, but urged abſolute ſubſcription to the great trouble of many Non-conformiſts. Nor could any amendment of the Liturgy ever be procured, but on the contrary, ſome paſſages left out that reflected much on the Papiſts, as that Petition in the Letany, <hi>from the Tyranny of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>good Lord deliver us,</hi> and a whole Prayer in the office for Gun-powder Treaſon expung'd by <hi>B. Laud,</hi> wherein it was ſaid, <hi>that the Religion of Papiſts is Rebellion, their Faith fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their practice the Murthering of Souls, and Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor were any of the Ceremonies taken away, or their impoſition remitted, but rather more added to them by the Biſhops Cannons, though not by Parliament. The Croſs in Baptiſm was confirmed and inforced, <hi>Can.</hi> 30. Under K. <hi>James,</hi> and the explication there given, increaſed the ſuſpition of the unlawfulneſs of it, they alſo brought in bowing at the name of Jeſus, <hi>Can.</hi> 18. And their dipping of Children in Baptiſm, turning the Communion Tables
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97114:22"/>into Altars, bowing towards them, or towards the Eaſt, (for they agree not what it was they bowed toward,) were brought in by <hi>B. Laud,</hi> and preſſed with great Rigour, though never eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law. In <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> Reign they were content that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Read the Service Book, without declaring their judgment concerning it, only it was ſaid in the 39 Articles, <hi>viz, Artic.</hi> 36. That the Book of Conſecration contained nothing that was in it ſelf ſuperſtitious or ungodly. But Arch Biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> deviſed a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his own, and impoſed it upon all to be ordained after that time which was at length turned into a Cannon, <hi>Can.</hi> 36. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</hi> 2. In theſe words, <hi>that the Book of Common Prayer, and of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, containeth nothing in it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God, and that it may Lawfully be uſed, and that he himſelf will uſe the form in the ſaid Book preſcribed, in publick Prayers, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and no other.</hi> The Biſhop knew that the Non-Conformiſts thought the Croſs in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (preſcribed in the Common Prayer Book,) unlawfull and againſt the Word of God, and that ſome of them thought the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Biſhops unlawfull alſo, and all of them the order of Deacons as preſcribed by that Book, and yet here they muſt ſubſcribe not only that they will uſe the book, and no other form in publick; but that it contains nothing contrary to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>This ſubſcription was not only impoſed on thoſe that ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be ordained, but it is alſo decreed that no man ſhall be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Preach or Catechize, or be a Lecturer, or read any Lecture in Divinity in the Univerſities, Cathedral, or Colligiate Churches, or in City, Market, Town, Church or Chappel whatſoever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realm, unleſs he firſt ſubſcribed to this Article; with two others contained in this Cannon, and by means hereof many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miniſters were quickly turned out of their Livings, though the Lawyers generally declared that it was againſt the Laws of the Land, that any man ſhould be turned out of his Free-hold, (ſuch as Miniſters Livings are,) without an Act of Parliament, and to make all ſure, they ordained Cannon 55, that Preachers before all Sermons, Lectures or Homilies, ſhould only invite the people to pray, naming a few heads of Prayer, which reſpect the publick on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and none concerning the people in particular, ſo that now no other Prayer muſt be uſed in publick, but thoſe in the Service Book, which made the Burthen more intolerable. Moreover in this Book of Canons they ordain that Miniſters ſhall admit none to the Lords
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97114:23"/>Supper that will not kneel, or that come not to the Prayers, or that ſpeak againſt the Book of Common Prayer or Ceremonies, or the book of Conſecration of Biſhops,<note place="margin">Can. <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Till they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Fault in word or writing if they can. That Fathers ſhall not be God-Fathers to their own Children, nor ſo much as urged to be preſent at their Baptiſm. In a word all that the Biſhops knew, that the Non-Conformiſts were diſſatisfied with,<note place="margin">Can. <hi>29.</hi>
                  </note> in the Service Book were eſtabliſhed by theſe Cannons, and they rigorouſly proſecuted upon them from that time, <hi>viz,</hi> 1603 to 1640.</p>
               <p>For the Government of the Church by Biſhops, and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Government by Lay-Chancellours Commiſſaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> time the Governours were contented with a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſubmiſſion from the Non-Conformiſts, but under K. <hi>James</hi> the Cannons fore-named enjoyned all Miniſters to ſubſcribe, that there was nothing in the Book of Conſecration of Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons contrary to the Word of God. And now B. <hi>Billſon</hi> and B. <hi>Andrews</hi> pleaded for the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, and <hi>B. Laud</hi> impoſed an Oath (commonly called the Oath <hi>&amp; Caetera,</hi>) upon the Clergy, whereby they ſhould promiſe, not to endeavour to alter the Government of the Church as it was eſtabliſhed by Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus all the moderation that had been uſed by the former Biſhops in preſſing things ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, was turned into the moſt rigorious impoſition of them, yea and of additions to them alſo, as if <hi>Rohoboam's</hi> ſucceſs ſhould terrify no man from acting according to his anſwer to the People, that he would add to their burthens, and change their Whips into Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and this leads to the next reaſon of the Diſſent of thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Non-Conformiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rea.</hi> 6. The Tyrannical Impoſition of the Lyturgy, and all that belonged to it, was a great means to increaſe their diſſatisfaction. There had been a paſſage in the Preface of the Common Prayer book, <hi>that the firſt Reformers had gone as farr as they could, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Church, conſidering the times they lived in, and they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thoſe that came after them would, as they better might do more.</hi> And indeed this was the Ground of the ſubmiſſion and patience of the Non-Conformiſts, <hi>viz,</hi> a perſwaſion that the firſt Reformers at leaſt the beſt of them did not intend their moddle as a <hi>ne plus ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> and therefore they ſtill hoped, that by Patience and peaceable
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97114:23"/>endeavours, things might by begrees be brought to a better paſs; accordingly they preſented an admonition to the Parliament; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1570. And again a Petition to <hi>K. James</hi> called the Millinary Petition for eaſe and redreſs; but alas! as that paſſage of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers is left out of the Preface to the ſervice book, ſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pungers of it fixed a juſt contrary mark to themſelves, which they aim at to this day in all their proceedings; <hi>viz,</hi> that there was no neceſſity of any farther Reformation, then what was eſtabliſhed by Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and that all muſt be compelled to approve of that as ſufficient, and to ſubmit to the Rules of it.</p>
               <p>The better to proſecute this deſign, they have ever laboured to ſet the Princes againſt the Non-conformiſts, and themſelves have uſed the Spiritual Sword chiefly againſt them, they did what they could to prejudice that Excellent Princeſs Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> againſt them ſo that in her Reign eſpecially when <hi>Whitgift,</hi> was Arch-Biſhop, the Non-Conformiſts were turned out of Univerſities, as Dr <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Dean of Chriſts-Church in <hi>Oxford,</hi> Mr <hi>Cartwright</hi> Margarite Profeſſour at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and many others, many were turned out of Livings, ſome worthy men impriſoned, and Mr <hi>John <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dall</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> was ſentenced to dye for high Treaſon againſt the Queen, in Defaming her Government, which ſaith Dr <hi>Fuller</hi> was ſomewhat hard, being but a remote conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for all that was alledged againſt him was, that in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to a certain book; he had ſharply taxed the Remiſſneſs of the Biſhops Government. And now ſuch was the Rigour of Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Non-Conformiſts, and the remiſneſs of Diſcipline toward the ignorant and ſcandalous, both Miniſters and People, that it gave occaſion to many to ſeparate from, and renounce the Church of <hi>England</hi> as no true Church, who were then called <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> when K. <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown, the Biſhops ſo quickly incenſed him againſt the Diſſenters, that in the conference at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court</hi> appointed on purpoſe to hear their exceptions, he would ſcarce give them leave to ſpeak, he ſent them away with taunts and threats, and often declared that were men never ſo able and pious, yet the Church had better want their labours, then have her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders broken by their Non-Conformity, <hi>which maxime I am ſorry to find Dr</hi> Stillingfleet <hi>to eſpouſe,</hi> Under K. <hi>Charles</hi> the 1ſt, the Biſhops had ſo wholly engaged the civil power in their cauſe, that it was almoſt the only concern of the Government how to bring all the Non-Conformiſts in <hi>England</hi> to ſubmit, or to leave the Land,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97114:24"/>and to bring <hi>Ireland</hi> to the ſame plat-form with <hi>England,</hi> and to ſet up Biſhops, Lyturgies and Ceremonies, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and now Miniſters and People were driven many thouſands into <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Holland,</hi> and other Forreign Parts, they were ſuſpended, ſilenced, deprived of their Livings, impriſoned, fined, ſet in the Pillory ſtigmatized, had their ears cut off, baniſhed into remote Iſlands, and many other ſuch preſſures were laid upon them, which many living yet remember.</p>
               <p>Nor were the Biſhops ever aſhamed to uſe their own power, and to appear in perſon againſt theſe men, in what danger ſoever Church or State was, Conformity muſt be urged, and Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts ſuppreſſ'd. In the very beginning of Reformation Mr <hi>Hooper</hi> was impriſoned by <hi>B. Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> for refuſing the uſe of ſome Ceremonies, when he was to be conſecrated Biſhop, and though the King by his Letter under his own hand commanded them to diſpenſe with him, yet they would not condeſcend: when a Congregation of Exiles for Religion, were ſetled at <hi>Franckford,</hi> under Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> becauſe they had laid aſide the Engliſh Liturgy and Ceremonies; <hi>B. Cox</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> and his Company coming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the ſame City, firſt quarrelled with them, and diſturbed them in the Church, and then incenſed the Magiſtrates againſt them, ſo that they were forced to leave the City to find other refuge. The Mouths of all the Cannons almoſt are Levelled againſt the Non-Conformiſts, none almoſt but they felt the Rigour of the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Star-Chamber Courts, few were ſuſpended, ſilenee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or fined, or excommunicated, but for not uſing the Croſs, not wearing the Surplice, following Sermons abroad, for not kneeling at the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> was ſuſpended from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and benefice 12 years together, and fined two thouſand pound to the King, only for giving the Lords Supper unto two of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh without kneeling, and the Communicants Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ditton</hi> were fined each of them 1000 pounds for receiving without kneeling. And how Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> exceeded all before him in proſecuting the Non-Conformiſts, is freſh in Memory.</p>
               <p>Now the uſage of them, beſides that it might exaſperate the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, and alienate them from the things impoſed, which is incident to all men, it did alſo add weight to their Reaſons againſt Conformity; becauſe they ſaw that the Biſhops preſſed their own Laws and Conſtitutions more then the Laws of Chriſt. That they uſurped authority without, and againſt the conſent of the Church,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97114:24"/>not only to enjoyn things on their practiſe, but alſo to impoſe the approbation of them upon their judgments, and conſciences which they knew before hand were diſſatisfied in thoſe things, and alſo that they were now become declared enemies to further reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thought they ſhould rather abate of the Firſt Reformation, and go nearer to <hi>Rome</hi> then ſtir one Hairs breadth further from her. This made Conformity juſtly more ſcrupled, when after 90 years endeavours for reformation, they had <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Anſwer, and were beaten to their burthens, and not ought of the tale of their brick to be diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>And now the caſe between the Conformiſts and Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts is quite altered, <hi>viz:</hi> after the making of the Cannons 1603. before the queſtion was, whether the things impoſed as Liturgy, Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might not be born with, eſpecially with help of ſome connivances of moderate Biſhops in thoſe things that they moſt ſcrupled, becauſe it was but the beginning of reformation, and the Governours both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, were not yet weaned from the old Diſcipline and cuſtoms of their Fathers, nor were the people likely to bear more purity, and to part with all their old cuſtoms at once, and upon theſe grounds the Non-Conformiſts kept the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and generally ſubmitted to the practiſe of moſt things impoſed: but now ſince all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore complained of, were turned into Cannons, and ſtanding Laws and muſt not only be practiſed, but approved alſo under their hands, to ſtand upon record in the Regiſters of the Biſhops Courts, and all that would not ſubſcribe muſt be caſt out, or kept out of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and the People likewiſe were generally weary of the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as well as the Miniſters, and diſliked them as too much ſymbolizing with <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore all the Church Cenſures muſt be bent againſt them whom the Cannons called Schiſmaticks for this cauſe only. Now I ſay the queſtion was whether the firſt reformation was not compleat?<note place="margin">Can: <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> and we ought not to go any further from <hi>Rome,</hi> in Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Ceremonies, Government and Diſcipline, but take up with them as a perfect Church Moddle, at leaſt ſuch as had no other imperfections in it, then all Conſtitutions in this world are ſubject to?</p>
               <p>This alteration of the ſtate of the Queſtion was much increaſed, when the Court and our Princes took up new meaſures of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Popiſh Princes abroad, and mixing intereſt with them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97114:25"/>whereby they were neceſſitated to deſert the protection and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which they had hitherto given to Proteſtants abroad, (which the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants in their wars quickly felt the effects of,) but alſo to remit their zeal againſt the Papiſts at home <hi>viz:</hi> to ſuſpend the execution of Laws againſt them, to entertain them at Court, to receive them into offices, to ſuffer their Prieſts and Jeſuits to come over in multitudes, and quickly to ſeduce the people: and that which was a neceſſary conſequence of all this to diſcountenance and puniſh Zealous Miniſters and People, who found fault with theſe proceedings, as Puritanes, overhot, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet factious, and enemies to the State; for this practiſe of the Court drew the Church along with it, as it uſually doth: and all men that had a mind to riſe muſt plead for the Lawfulneſs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Marrying with Papiſts, and allowing them their worſhip, and of conniving at Papiſts amongſt us, and at laſt to ſtudy to gratifie and meet the Papiſts as farr as they could, and to bring back more of their Doctrines and Ceremonies, till at length it was become an indifferent thing, whether a man was a Papiſt or a Proteſtant, ſo he were not a Puritane, and continued in that Church he was born and baptized in. <hi>Vid Ruſhw. Col. Part</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 213, <hi>The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Cenſure of Mr.</hi> Mountagues <hi>Papers.</hi> This temper did the Church men fall into immediately upon the publick attempt for the Spaniſh match, and it ſpread more amongſt them, till Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> being made head of the party, had almoſt made a ſecond ſort of Non-Conformiſts, <hi>viz,</hi> Puritane Conformiſts, as they called them, <hi>i. e.</hi> Thoſe that conformed to the Liturgy and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed by Law, but could not approve of the new deſign of moderation toward, and Union with the Papiſts, which the Arch-Biſhop and all his followers profeſſed and owned.</p>
               <p>And now the caſe was altered to purpoſe, for it was now Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſm and Faction to be an Anti-Arminian, to be zealous againſt Popery, to preach twice a Sabbath, to pray before or after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to keep the Sabbath Holy, and in a word to be ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, in the people? and for the Miniſters to preach for it, this was Puritaniſm; and our Reformers were thought too nice and ſtrait-laced, our Articles and Homilies too ſtrict, and fit to be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and our Martyrs Fools and Rebels. The Non-Conformiſts now thought they had great reaſon to ſtand off from Conformity, ſeeing all their fears were verified before their eyes; that our near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Rome</hi> would endanger our returning to her again, and ſeeing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97114:25"/>Conformity it ſelf, to Law and Canons would ſignify little, unleſs a man would go beyond both, in obedience to his Superiours, to promote the new deſign. This was the caſe of the old Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts till the long Parliament ſtopped the ſtream: upon the whole we may obſerve, the caſe betwixt our former Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and the Church of <hi>England</hi> was the ſame in ſubſtance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Brethren of <hi>Bohemiah</hi> and the <hi>Calixtines,</hi> the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Bohemian Calextines,</hi> if the Pope would grant them the Cup, in the Sacrament, and three or four more reformations of abuſes in the Roman Church, they thought it reformation enough, and that they need go no farther, and they would compell the brethren who were for a total deſertion of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be of the ſame mind and practiſe with them, and that by force of Arms. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> having only reformed the Doctrine of the Church, and the Idolatry of the Maſs, and caſt off the Popes Tyranny and ſome other corruptions of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Adoration of the Sacrament, kneeling to it, Surplices, Images, Holy days, and could not be content to do this themſelves, unleſs they could perſwade and inforce all Proteſtants to do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Hence they will not own the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as brethren, nor hold any Communion with them, nor receed from any thing they had taken up, but rather proceed to take in more of the Popiſh Doctrines, as thoſe we call Arminianiſm, and have often treated, ſeriouſly ſome of them, about reconciliation with the Papiſts; but always fruſtrated, yea deteſted any endeavours of it with the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts: Thus the Conformiſts of <hi>England</hi> have contended ſo much for their Liturgy and Service, and Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they would compell all to be content with the ſame moddle with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and would not ſuffer any to be Miniſters or Members of the Church, that would deſire any further reformation: and at laſt come to this pitch, that they would rather take in more of <hi>Rome,</hi> yea reconcile with her upon ſome terms, than abate any thing to their brethren. Nor were theſe the actions of a few particular men, but of all the Heads of the Church, Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops generally age after age. The worſt of their principle and practiſes were never condemned by the Church, but made the way to the higheſt preferments; ſo that the moderation of a few amongſt them will no more excuſe the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then a few ſober Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts may excuſe the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Non-conformiſts instified in their Principles by Scripture, Antiquity, and the Example of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches.</head>
               <p>THe Non-conformiſts as they gave the forenamed reaſons why they could not approve of, or ſubſcribe to the Conſtitutions of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo they ſuppoſed that this their diſſent was not grounded upon meer ſcruples and weakneſs of judgement (though their Oppoſites love to impute it to ſuch Cauſes) but they alleadged for themſelves the Authority of Scripture, and the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both of the Primitive and the late Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Scriptures they pleaded, that there was neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, example, nor ſhadow of any Liturgy, <hi>i. e. preſcript form of words, wherein all the publick worſhip of God ſhould be adminiſtred,</hi> either in the Old or New Teſtament, under the Law the externals and circumſtances of Gods worſhip were much more preſcribed and limitted than under the Goſpel, as the place, the Tabernacle or Temple time, Morning and Evening, yet was it never command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all the Prieſts and People ſhould uſe the ſame form of words in prayer, when and where ever they met. There is indeed a form of bleſſing the people, when the Aſſembly was to be diſmiſſed, but that conſiſted in but a few words, nor can it be proved that they uſed always thoſe very words, or that it was ſo intended in the command, (<hi>Num.</hi> 6.22. to the end,) the ſame words are often uſed in Scripture to ſignifie the ſame ſence, or to that purpoſe, not the ſame Syllables, and ſo it is in all Authors, nor is there any form of words preſcribed wherein men ſhould confeſs their ſins over the Sacrifices, or wherein Circumciſion or the Paſſover ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, but on the contrary we find, <hi>David, Solomon, Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, Hazekiah, Ezra,</hi> the Levites in <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> time and others prayed <hi>pro re nata</hi> according to the occaſion, as their own hearts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them. And therefore it ſeems as God did not command, ſo neither did the Jewiſh Church make and enjoyn any ſtated Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97114:26"/>unleſs any ſhall unhappily take the Superſtious and ridiculous Liturgy of the preſent Jews to have been uſed amongſt them from the beginning: Certainly there is no footſteps of any ſuch thing in our Saviours time, who duly kept to the rules of Gods worſhip, and broke no good orders of the Church. The Apoſtles alſo as long as they could, frequented the Jewiſh Temple and Synagogues, but of any Platforms of Prayer or Service, other then the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Law, we find no memorial; Now if the Jewiſh Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood were able to diſcharge their Office without preſcript forms of words, and that people might be ſafely committed to their Prieſts in the exerciſe of each mans own gifts, how much better may it be done, and ſuch liberty granted, both to Miniſters and People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, where the Spirit of God, and the means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are given much more abundantly? Nor are there more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of any Liturgy in the New Teſtament, then their was in the old either preſcribed by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, or uſed by them, or commanded to future Churches. Nor any rule laid down where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Churches might ground their practiſe of framing, and impoſing ſuch Lyturgies, But we read, that when our Lord Jeſus aſcended into Heaven he gave gifts to men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16 <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> Apoſtles Prophets, and Evangeliſts to lay the foundation of his Church, and Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting the Saints, <hi>for the work of the Miniſtry, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,</hi> unto the meaſure of the ſtature in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. from whence it ſeemeth plain, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt thought it ſufficient to appoint a ſtanding Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to take care of his Church to the end of the world, and to furniſh them with the gifts of his Spirit to edifie the people, and to keep the unity of the faith, with out requiring, or authorizing them, to make Lyturgies, whereby to fetter themſelves, or others.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Scriptures give neither command, example, nor countenance, to the peoples anſwering in Publick worſhip more then Amen; only, at the cloſe of Publick Prayer. It is probable that the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the Temple ſtanding Ward againſt Ward, did ſing alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>i. e.</hi> one rank one ſentence, and another rank another, as they do in our Cathedrals, but this was not the people, and they were an Order of men appointed by <hi>David</hi> by Divine inſpiration, for this work, and ſo the manner and method alſo, was appointed by God, and Art, and rules of Muſick, were then acceptable, and part of the Ceremonial worſhip. But there being ſuch Offices, nor ſuch
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97114:27"/>ſervice appointed in the Chriſtian Church, this is no warrant for our Reſponſes.</p>
               <p>Neither do the Scriptures give any warrant or example for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving dayes as ſacred in the honour of Saints, Or of inſtituting new Offices in the Church, or new Ceremonies of worſhip, but on the contrary our Saviour declares that men worſhip in vain that teach for Doctriens the Commandements of men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. It ſeems then, That Decency and Order which men purpoſely deviſe to add ſignificancy or comlineſs to gods worſhip is abominable in his ſight, he hath no need of mans ſervice, and therefore will accept of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is appointed and carried on by his own Spirit.</p>
               <p>Neither do the Scriptures appoint or warrant any ſuperiority of Biſhops above ordinary Miniſters, at leaſt not ſuch as that they ſhould have ſole power of governing the Church. The high Prieſts of old had no ſuch power of the Prieſts as this Learned Doctor hath proved in his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> They had ſome peculiar things appropriated to their office, but were themſelves ſubject to the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> The Apoſtles were all of one Order, and had no authority over each other, and governed the Church only by conſent, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. Nor is there any diſtinction made betwixt ordinary Miniſters, except what they ſee needful to make amongſt themſelves, for the good of the Church. This all our old Biſhops acknowledged, and therefore pleaded for Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy only as an humane conſtitution; And thoſe who of late wrote for its Divine-right, do yet, the moſt learned of them acknowledge, that it cannot be proved from Scripture, unleſs perhaps from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Church of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which this Dr. hath ſolidly confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>It was alwaies objected to the Non-conformiſts, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not forbid thoſe things though they do not command them, But they replyed that the Non-command of any thing in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Church is a prohibition, except of thoſe things only that occaſionally become neceſſary, or that are naturally, neceſſary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of ſuch actions as are commanded; for it would argue great imperfection in the Law, if it ſhould omit things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly or generally neceſſary for the good of the Church: And as <hi>Moſes</hi> cloſed his Law with this command that none ſhould adde or diminiſh it, ſo Chriſt having given his Law to his Church, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Officers with power to make, govern, and caſt members out of it as there was need, without giving them liberty to adde or alter; He alſo did virtually prohibit ſuch additions or alterations, till
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97114:27"/>he ſhall come again, and their Commiſſion being only to teach, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, and to teach all that Chriſt commands to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18.19. This doth ſufficiently reſtrain them from making or teaching cammands of their own, all their authority being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that Commiſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From Antiquity the Non-Conformiſts alledge that the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches for many hundred years had no ſtated Liturgies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the words as well as method of worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his ſecond Apoligy deſignedly gives an account of the Chriſtian worſhip, <hi>viz,</hi> the order and method of praying, preaching, admitting of Members, adminiſtring both Sacraments, but hath no word of a preſcribed form; but he ſaith the Miniſter prayed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as he was able, <hi>Tertullian</hi> giving the ſame account in his <hi>Apol. Cap.</hi> 39. ſaith likewiſe, <hi>ſine monitore quia de pectore ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> they prayed by heart, and therefore had no prompter, much leſs a book.</p>
               <p>We read that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great,<note place="margin">Euſeb. de vit: conſtant. l. <hi>4.</hi> cap: <hi>19.20.</hi>
                  </note> having aboliſhed idolatry, compoſed a form of Prayer for his Heathen Souldiers, wherein t hey ſhould pray to one God the Creatour of all things, but we read of no form impoſed on Chriſtians. There are indeed Lyturgies that goe under the names of the Apoſtle <hi>James, Baſil, Chryſostome,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> but they convince themſelves to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by later men, and ſo are an argument that there were no ſuch things in the primitive times, but when the Church was over-run with errours and ſuperſtitions, it was appointed in <hi>Africa,</hi> that the Miniſters ſhould either receive a form of Prayer from their Biſhops,<note place="margin">Canſil. Milevet. <hi>2</hi> dum. Can. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> or ſhew their own Prayer to them for their approbation, but this was above 400 years after Chriſt, the uſurpation of Biſhops, Lazines, and ambition of Miniſters, ignorance and ſuperſtition in the people bred Liturgies, and they grew up together. Nor is their any mention of Reſponſes in the Antient Church, a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtory of a viſion of Angels ſinging an Hymn, in that manner by turns, is pretended to be ſeen by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> dead long before, nor had the antient Church, days holy to Saints for 300 years and upward, we find only mention amongſt them of Eaſter-day, and yet that cauſed ſuch diviſion and contentions that it might have been a warning to after ages for contending about things that God hath not commanded.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:97114:28"/>
               <p>The Apocryphal Books were indeed read in the Chriſtian Church very antiently, though they never were amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but it was more excuſable in them then in us, becauſe it was long e're the books of the Scripture, eſpecially the books of the New Teſtament were gathered into one Volumn, or it was agreed among the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were Canonical, and which Apocryphal, for ſome of the Apocryphal were read in ſome Churches as Canonical, and ſome of the Canonical were by ſome Churches rejected. The Croſs in Baptiſm was ſo long unknown to the Church that it is hard to ſay when it came in, though the ſign of the Croſs was commonly uſed amongſt them upon their Cloaths, in their Hats, to diſtinguiſh them from Heathens, and as a token that they were Chriſtians, the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> began to make a ſuperſtititious uſe of the Croſs, and ſo did many others ſoon after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf can ſcarce be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, if <hi>Euſebius</hi> be credited, but that it was annexed to Baptiſm, and made a ſymbole of mens embracing Chriſtianity, there is no record. Kneeling at the Lords Supper was not enjoyned till tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantion was eſtabliſhed above 1200 years after Chriſt, nor is any general example for it pretneded in former ages.</p>
               <p>The Surplice was much Elder then the Croſs in Baptiſm, or kneeling at the Supper, yet for 200 years and upwards there is no mention of it, nor is it known when or how it came in; many Rites, Cuſtoms and Ceremonies were uſed in the Primitive Churches, ſome being derived from the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſome from the Heathens by the converts of both ſorts, yet not impoſed upon others, the Apoſtles Rule being yet obſerved that no man ſhould judge another in meats or drinks,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</note> or in reſpect of an holy day, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Jewiſh Feſtivals, which were once of divine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Nor did the firſt Churches pretend to make new Officers, or conſtitute any Government other then Chriſt appointed, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons are the Church Officers which they owned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is frequent mention of Biſhops in Antient Authors: but <hi>Auguſtine</hi> 400 years after Chriſt, ſaith, that a Biſhop was but <hi>titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus honoris</hi> a name of honour given to one Miniſter above the reſt, but that they were all alike, and his contemporary <hi>Hierome, olim Eccleſiae Communi Preſbyterorum concilio regebantur,</hi> that Churches were governed by the common conſent of the Presbytery; and of the practiſe of his own time he, ſaith <hi>quid facit Epiſcopus excepta ordinatione quod non facit Preſbyter,</hi> nothing but Ordination was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97114:28"/>appropriated to the Biſhop, the Presbyters did every thing elſe as well as he,<note place="margin">Jerom.

               <p n="3">3.

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Reaſons of the preſent Non-conformiſts, in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for their diſſent.</head>
               <p>THe Non-conformiſts of the preſent Age, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as cannot conform to the Lyturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to Act of Uniforty made 1662, have all the ſame reaſons for their Non-conformity, that their Predeceſſours had, and ſome new ones peculiar to themſelves, for both all the ſame things in the Lyturgy and Government which were a burthen to their Fathers, are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on them, without the leaſt abatement, amendment, or alteration; and alſo new impoſitions are laid upon them, to make the yoke more intollerable, Theſe are ſuch as follow,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they were denyed all Reformation of the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> and Government of the Church. It was now ſomewhat above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years that there had been continued deſires of amendment in the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> and Government, but none could be obtained. King <hi>James</hi> in the beginning of his Reign made a ſhew of hearing the Non-conformiſts objections in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> But the iſſue was only to make a greater pretence to enjoyn Conformity
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97114:29"/>more ſtrictly, as having heard all their Reaſons againſt it, and found nothing worthy conſideration in them. In like manner the preſent Non-conformiſts were dealt with, for as we are told in the Preface to the Act of Uniformity: Firſt ſome Divines both Conformiſts and Non-conformiſts were by Commiſſion appointed to review the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice book, and to make neceſſary amendments in it; next, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Conforming Clergy was called to re-view the book, laſt of all his Majeſty had ſeen and re-viewed what they had done, and the iſſue of all this was, that the Epiſtles and Goſpels ſhould be read in the new Tranſlation, and to amend two or three words, which by the fault of the Printers had crept into the Book and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſence, and nothing conſiderable, and then the Book paſſed an Act of Parliament, requiring more rigorous Conformity then ever before. The Parliament not once reading the book, but with an implicite faith (as a Member of the Houſe of Commons ſaid) paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and confirm'd (under the higheſt penalties next to death it ſelf,) that which they never ſaw, nor examined. And yet now the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for Non-conformity were ſtronger then before, There had been ſufficient time to wean the people from the Modes and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in diſpute, yea and the body of the people were now ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary of them, and the greater number of Learned and pious Miniſters deſired they might be laid aſide above all, they had been laid aſide about ſixteen years, and the people were well content, nor was there any decay of knowledge, or piety amongſt them upon this alteration. Now was there a fair occaſion to have amended any thing amiſs, and for the Biſhops to have there Non-conforming bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren gratified in any reaſonable things, who were now as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as themſelves for Number, and intereſt with the People, and yet offered to conſent to any reaſonable terms of accomodation; ſurely all this did neither encourage nor oblige the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts to ſubmit to that new Act of Uniformity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But inſtead of amending any thing amiſs, or diſliked in the Liturgy, ſome things were added to make it more offenſive, <hi>viz,</hi> Sundays are more expreſly reckoned as Church-Feaſts; than in the former book, the new book ſaith thus, <hi>a Table of all the Feaſts that are to be obſerved in the Church of</hi> England <hi>through the year, all Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days in the year.</hi> The former book thus, <hi>theſe holy days to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and no other, all Sundays in the year;</hi> The word Holy-day, which was ſomewhat ſuſpicious is now changed to Feaſt-day, and Sundays put in the number of Feaſt-days, without any diſtinction,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97114:30"/>which makes it more evident that they are accounted but Church Feſtivals. The 29 of <hi>September</hi> in the old book is appointed a Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, the new book adds, <hi>and to all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> ſo that this is a Feſtival in the honour of all the Angels as the Firſt of <hi>Novemb.</hi> is in honour of all the Saints, alſo two new Holy-days are added, never before enjoyned by the former book, <hi>viz:</hi> St <hi>Pauls</hi> Converſion, and St <hi>Barnabas.</hi> Moreover in the book of Conſecration ſeveral paſſages are added, declaring Biſhops to be a diſtinct order from the Presbyters, and the <hi>36th Artic.</hi> is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be underſtood of this book, herein they contradict the Law, and the Judgment of all our firſt Reformers in K. <hi>Edw.</hi> and Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> days, and the very book of Conſecration it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nevertheleſs all Miniſters are to approve this book, and that by a publick declaration in the Congregation, when they firſt enter upon their Miniſtry in theſe words and no other, <hi>I,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">vid. Act. of unif. Ann. <hi>14</hi> Can. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>A, B do here declare my unfeigned aſſent, and conſent, to all and every thing contained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in, and by the book entituled the book of Common Prayer, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according to the uſe of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>together with the Pſalter of Pſalms of</hi> David, <hi>pointed as they are to be ſung or ſaid in Churches; and the form or manner of making, ordaining, and conſecrating of Biſhops, Prieſt and Deacons.</hi> It is ſaid in excuſe of this impoſition, that it is only a conſent to the uſe, not an approbation of the truth, and goodneſs, of all contained in the book, becauſe the words immediate foregoing are, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould declare their unfeigned aſſent and conſent to the uſe of all things in that book contained and preſcribed. Be it ſo, and that the words Aſſent and Conſent ſignifie the ſame things after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Lawyers, though ſome doubt it, and thoſe words to the uſe, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> are not expreſſed in the form of a Declaration, which they ought to have been; yet we muſt obſerve. Firſt, That this was a further alteration of the Caſe of Conformity, to make it more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Act of Uniformity, only required that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould be bound to read the book of Common Prayer, and no other Liturgies or forms of prayer in publick: The Canons went further, and did require they ſhould ſubſcribe at their Ordination before the Biſhop, that the book of Common Prayer and of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hath nothing in it contrary to the word of God, that it may be lawfully uſed, and that he himſelf will uſe that, and no other; but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97114:30"/>this new Declaration is to be made publickly before the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on forfeiture of their Miniſtry and place, that ſo there may be no favour ſhewed to any. Alſo it requireth unfeigned Aſſent and Conſent, which cannot mean leſs then an hearty approbation of the uſe of what is enjoyned, which is much more then barely to judge that nothing is contrary to Gods word, and that they may be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed. This Aſſent and Conſent is to be made to all, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing contained in, and preſcribed by the book of Common Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then the particulars are ſpecified, <hi>viz:</hi> the Prayers, the Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and of other Rites and Ceremonies, and the book of ordering Biſhops, Prieſts, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and the Pſalter or Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> as they uſe to be ſaid in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Here is nothing omitted of all thoſe things the Non-Conformiſts uſed to object againſt, ſome as unlawfull, and others as inconvenient, and not for edification, yet now they muſt from their hearts allow the uſe of them each one in particular, not omitting the corrupt tranſlation of the Pſlams, contradicted by our own allowed Bibles, which how they could do, who long contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that many of theſe things ought to be reformed, let all that have Conſcience judg. The Non-Conformiſts think no form of words could have been contrived more ſpitefully either to keep them from conforming, or to make them lay waſt their Conſciences, if they did conform, beſides that, they know from the mouths of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers, that they did deſign it for theſe ends, that they might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther root out every branch of Conformity out of mens judgments, or every Non-Conformiſt out of the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Act requires this Aſſent and Conſent, not only of all that ſhould hereafter enter the Miniſtry, but of all thoſe likewiſe that were already Miniſters, and were either Paſtours or Lecturers in any Congregation, and this Declaration to be made together with the ſubſcription hereafter to be mentioned by a certain day, <hi>viz,</hi> before the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt, Anno</hi> 1662, whereas it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known that the book of Common Prayer came not out of the preſs abroad, till within two or three days of that ſaid <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> ſo that it was impoſſible that it ſhould be ſeen, much more that it ſhould be conſidered by half the Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> before that day, and thoſe that were reſolved to keep their Places, did a great part of them ſubſcribe before they had read the book; which practiſe doth manifeſt a further deſign to root out all that made any Conſcience of what they ſaid or ſubſcribed, ſeeing they muſt doe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97114:31"/>it without conſideration, or looſe their places; however to deviſe and impoſe new Terms of Communion upon men, that are in the quiet poſſeſſion and practice of their miniſtry is very unjuſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all peace; and by this practiſe men ſhall never be at quiet, for though they have conform'd to all things enjoyned, they know not how ſoon a prevailing faction will enjoyn them more, nor what that will be, eſpecially the things enjoyned in the Declaration and Subſcription being ſuch as was known before hand, many of the Miniſters in place could not ſubſcribe to, with ſafe Conſciences. It is apparent that their deſign was, not the peace of the Church, but to remove them out of the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is further required, that all ſhould have Epiſcopal Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ſhould in any ſort exerciſe the Miniſtry, had this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned only thoſe that ſhould thereafter come to be ordained, it had been more tolerable (though it would have been contrary to Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> moderation, and reflecting upon all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches,<note place="margin">An. Eliz. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> who have not Epiſcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and yet do receive and permit our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters among them that are Epiſcopally ordained,) but to impoſe upon them that were Miniſters already, and had performed all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as Miniſters many years, and many of them with good ſucceſs, and who could not, if they would be ordained by Biſhops for near twenty years before, there being alſo no Law or Canon, requiring all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be ordained by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop as neceſſary to their Miniſtry. I ſay, now to impoſe upon theſe men, that they muſt leave their places or be ordained by the Biſhop, was purpoſely to caſt a ſtumbling block before them not eaſily to be paſſed over, for hereby they muſt acknowledge Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ordination to be unlawfull, contrary to the judgment and practiſe of all Ages and Churches,<note place="margin">Vid. Blandel Apol. C. <hi>2.</hi> and Maſons vind: of the Ordin. of Ref. Churches.</note> and particularly of our own till this time, and alſo acknowledge themſelves all this while, to have been no Miniſters, and their Baptiſm to be no Baptiſm, unleſs Lay-men may Baptize which is contrary to the Common Prayer book reformed by K. <hi>James</hi> in that point, who could do this that have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned over their Conſcience to the will of men?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Act further requires that all Miniſters, whether ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or to be ordained, ſhould before the Ordinary make this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſubſcription. <hi>I. A. B. do declare that it is not Lawfull up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97114:31"/>any pretence whatſoever to take arms againſt the King, and that I do abhor that trayterous poſition of taking Arms by his authority againſt his Perſon, or againſt thoſe that are Commiſſioned by him, and than I will conform to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is now by Law eſtabliſhed, and I do declare that I do hold, there lies on Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon me, or any other perſon, from the Oath commonly called the Solemn League and Covenant, to endeavour any change or alteration of Government either in Church or State, and that the ſame was in it ſelf an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfull Oath, and impoſed upon the Subjects of this Realm, againſt the known Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom.</hi> The two firſt clauſes of this ſubſcription are meerly civil, concerning Civil Government, and ſome circumſtances of that Government, not the ſubſtance of it, and things greatly controverted amongſt Lawyers and Stateſmen. Now to impoſe ſuch things upon Miniſters of the Goſpel, that belong not to their office to know, much leſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine is very unreaſonable, and to impoſe things concerning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs, as Conditions or Terms of being ordained Miniſters of the Goſpel, is a great uſurpation on the Authority of Chirſt, as if he muſt not have Miniſters in his Church, unleſs they engage at the ſame time to ſerve the particular ends of a State. Beſides, the firſt caluſe, <hi>viz. That it is unlawfull to take up Arms againſt the King upon any pretence whatſoever,</hi> is doubtfull in the ſence, <hi>viz,</hi> whether it reſpect the Law of the Land, or the Law of God, and therefore cannot with good Conſcience be ſubſcribed. And if it be meant of the Law of God, it is againſt the judgment of the beſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, as well as of the beſt Divines, it hath no tolerable proof from Scripture. They that abuſe the <hi>13th</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, forget or are ignorant, that <hi>Nero</hi> whom they ſay the Apoſtle meant, was adjudged a publick Enemy of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſentenced to dye: it is therefore a moſt unreaſonable thing that this ſhould be impoſed to be ſubſcribed by all young men entring into the Miniſtry, which may by the Canons be at the Age of 24 years, (and by practiſe ſeldom exceeds) before they can be fit to judge of ſuch points.</p>
               <p>The ſecond clauſe, <hi>viz. I abhorre,</hi> &amp;c. in its full extent is againſt the known Lawes and practiſe of the Land, in divers inſtances given by others, and practiſed in ſeveral Cauſes, in his now Majeſties Reign; And muſt Miniſters be turned out, and be debarred of the Miniſtry unleſs they will wound, their own and their Countreys Rights and liberties, and that for the moſt part before they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97114:32"/>what they doe? Moreover that the true meaning of theſe two clauſes is a ſnare to the people, and dangerous to their Rights and Priviledges (contrary to all the lax interpretations deviſed by ſome) appeareth beyond contradiction, by the ſence that the Houſe of Peers gave of them, both the words, and deſign of impoſing, when they ſo vigorouſly oppoſed its being made a Teſt for all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament men in all future Ages. And let it be remembred that theſe were the Law-makers, and moſt of them perſons concerned in making this Law, therefore beſt knew the meaning of thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and alſo had Authority to declare the ſence of them, and were yet ſitting in that ſame Parliament, that made the law.</p>
               <p>The third clauſe in this ſubſcription is, <hi>I will conform to the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of the Church of England;</hi> This was to oblige the young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of Colledges, and Tutors in the Univerſities, before they came to give Aſſent and Conſent, and to be a double cord upon the Miniſtry. But many who could ſilently conform, cannot ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſcribe a promiſe to conform, whereby they pre-engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt all change of their judgments.</p>
               <p>There fourth clauſe is, <hi>That I hold that there lies no obligation on me from the Covenant, nor upon any other that took it, to endeavour any alteration in Government in Church or State.</hi> There is ſcarce a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel in all Hiſtory to this, That a man ſhould be compell'd to ſwear for others, that they are not obliged by an Oath that they took; The impoſers might as well have ſaid, we will make you ſwear to any thing we pleaſe, or elſe you ſhall not continue in the Church: But the Non-conformiſts deſire to be ſatisfied, how the King (to paſs by all others) who ſwore to proſecute the ends of the Covenant in a moſt Publick and ſolemn manner, and that before he had ſworn to maintain Epiſcopacy, and agreed to take it upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation and advice, and that at <hi>Breda</hi> when he was under no fear or conſtraint, how he ſhould not be bound to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he then promiſed, and what man can abſolve him from that Oath, eſpecially an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, when that Oath was made to the <hi>Stots;</hi> it being an unqueſtionable rule, That none can releaſe another from a lawful Oath, but thoſe to whom the Oath was made, and into whoſe power the Jurer hath put himſelf by that Oath, This ought to have been firſt cleared, and not rigorouſly impoſed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It muſt be ſubſcribed, That the Covenant in it ſelf was an unlawful Oath, which the Non-conformiſts diſſallowing, our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97114:32"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy can by no means aſſent to; And that it was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the known Lawes and Liberties of this land, which few Miniſters have law enough to know, and therefore it ought not to be made a condition of the Miniſtry to ſubſcribe it.</p>
               <p>The Non-conformiſts find that this Act is wholly contrived to make them diſown and diſparage that Reformation which they had been engaged in for twenty year, and to make themſelves tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, to reproach their Brethren that were dead, to diſparage all the Providences of God in their behalf, and to villifie the ſucceſs of their own Miniſtry, and the growth of Religion and Sobriety in the Nation which they had ſeen, and been inſtruments of, and moreover to engage them againſt all endeavor of Reformation for the future, and all thoſe principles which their pious Predeceſſors had delivered to them, And therefore they think he that can do this is a ſervant of men and not of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>They do not juſtifie all proceedings in the endeavours for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, never any ſuch thing was attempted without many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the beſt, and tranſvers deſigns in ſelfiſh men. There were never more Hereſies, Schiſmes, and Superſtitions in the Church, then were in the Apoſtles dayes, and thoſe that immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, proportionable to the number of Chriſtians, the Goſpel being then but ſetting up in the world; But the Reformation it ſelf being good and neceſſary, and the effects of it as to Religion mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they cannot revile or renounce, without condemning thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which animated them to bring in the King, without regard of their own peerſonal peace, or intereſt: It is ſaid <hi>that</hi> Reformation wanted Authority, it did ſo, ſuch as ſhould make it National, but ſelves, and Rulers ought to protect them in it, and not to trouble them for it, or force them from it.</p>

Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Non conformiſts conceive the caſe betwixt them and the Conformiſts Clergy to be much the ſame as betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> ſince the Council of <hi>PTrent, i. e.</hi> differences are come to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt extremity under blood, (and that only, becauſe it is not in Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy mens power,) and are utterly irreconcileable The <hi>Lutherans</hi> formerly had ſome men amongſt them of ſome moderation, and the things in queſtion betwixt them and the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> wer diſputed and debated, and men left to their liberty both in judgment and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but when they got ſtrength enough, then they impoſed their ſubſcriptions, depoſed and impriſſoned the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> enveighed againſt them with all bitterneſs, will admit of no treaties of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and finally are ſo obſtinately fixed in their own way, as that they will much rather go three ſteps backwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> then come one forwards toward the <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi> alſo though they earneſtly oppoſed the Reformation, yet they maintained diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and debates, held conferences and conſultations with our firſt Reformers, and forbore violence (at leaſt by means of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,) a good while, ſo that there was hopes the Church might have been reformed without any fatal breach, <hi>hCharles 5th</hi> then Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and <hi>Francis</hi> the 1ſt K. of <hi>France,</hi> and others carneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to bring it about, but when after all, the Councill that had been deſired on both ſides met at <hi>Trent,</hi> and excluded the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants from voting amongſt them, and eſtabliſhed all the errours and corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and curſed all the Doctrines and Practiſes of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, point by point, that they ſhould have heard and examined. And finally, ordered all that ſhould be ordained to the Miniſtry to ſubſcribe to this Council; There was now no more hope of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church, or of pacification betwixt diſſenting parties. Thus the Non-conformiſt; being of the ſame date with the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97114:33"/>Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> Biſh. <hi>Coverdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> with others of the firſt Reformers, being diſſatisfied with the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> and ſtill more and more ſucceſſively in after Ages, were at firſt treated like brethren, and though the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law, by K. <hi>Edw.</hi> and Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> yet they required not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions to ſit, or approbation of it, being content with a ſilent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of what was enjoyned, and very frequently paſſed over with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the omiſſion or non-practiſe of the Ceremonies, and other things enjoined, till Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgifts</hi> dayes; all which time the Non-comformiſts had ſtill hopes things might have been accommodated, and they appplied themſelves to Princes and Parliaments to that end.</p>
               <p>At length the Canons in 1605 made by the whole Convocation (but with as fair play as thoſe at <hi>Trent</hi>) and ratified by the King, eſtabliſhed all things that the Non-comformiſts complained of, and that not in the groſs, but point by point, and fortified them with the Cenſures of the Church againſt all Diſſenters, and finally required all Miniſters to approve the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> by ſubſcription. Whereupon many werer turned out at preſent, and many kept from the Miniſtry, nevertheleſs theſe ſubſcriptions were private before the Biſhops and Ordinaries, who might and did frequently either omit, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, or qualifie it, with ſuch interpretations, that many who were in their Judgments Nonconformiſts, could and did ſtill get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and continue in places, and thoſe who were driven out of one Dioceſs, were frequently ſuffered to preach in another, and they who could not be ordained by Biſhops would procure Ordination in other Proteſtant Countreys; ſo that here was a little alleviation. There was alſo one ground of hope elft, <hi>viz.</hi> theſe Canons were not Law, another King, yea, the ſame that approved them, might have altered them, and therefore the Non-conformiſts ſtretched their patience to the utmoſt, hoping that at laſt their afflictions might be looked on by them that had power to remedy them, and ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it there was under the long Parliament, eſpecially when the King and they were upon terms of pacification, But behold the Concluſion, We have at length the private ſubſcription to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer Book turned into a Publick ſolemn Declaration in the Congregation, and that in preſcript form of words, that there may be no moderation. And this to extend to the unfeigned approbation of the uſe of every thing contained in the Book. And theſe Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Canons turned into a ſtanding law, which equally extends to all parts of the Realm, and to all times and ages ſucceſſively, as much as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97114:34"/>men can oblige them, ſo that there can eaſily be no alteration. And beſides all this they muſt not only approve the Liturgy, but they muſt renounce and diſown all their own and their Brethrens former endeavours for Reformation, and engage themſelves never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour reformation again, and whereas formerly they who by the Canons were made uncapable of Livings, were neverthleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to preach Lectures, and might ſometimes adminiſter the Sacraments, Tis now enjoyned that no man ſhall preach, or read any Lecture, unleſs he hath firſt made the fore-named Declaration and Subſcription upon pain of enduring Three Months impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Common-Goal, and beſides that, to pay an Hundred Pounds if he preſume to adminiſter the Lords Supper <hi>toties quoties.</hi> Alſo the former Non-Conformiſts were wont to teach School, at leaſt privately for the ſubſiſtance of their Families, and that they might beof ſome uſe. But now none muſt keep a publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate School without ſubſcribing againſt endeavours of Reformation, and promiſing to conform to the Liturgy. And all theſe impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are extended alſo to the Univerſity Collegiate Churches, Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, that ſo there ſhould be no retirement for a Non-Conformiſt, as formerly ſome have had in ſuch places, and that by pre-engaging the Youth before they underſtand what they do, there might be no new Non-Conformiſts to ſpring up hereafter, finally when by theſe mens they had turned out about Two Thouſand Miniſters out of Livings, and Fellows of Colledges out of the Univerſities, and bolted the door after them, that they could never return into ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all this was born with patience.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops procured another Act <hi>Anno</hi> 1665, to drive them out of all Towns, where they might have any Society or Comfort, unleſs they would ſubſcribe and ſwear a Declaration to the ſame purpoſe with the former ſubſcription, and moſtly in the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and we add to all this, that theſe Declarations and Subſcript<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions were at the ſame time impoſed upon the Miniſters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> though Presbyterial-Government and Diſcipline was there eſttabliſhed by Law, and their Conſtitution by the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that ſo there might be no relief, no retreat from one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to another, and that the Principles of Non-conformity might be Rooted out of all-together, from hence I ſay it is manifeſt that nothing would ſatisfy the Conformiſts but the Ruine of the Non-Conformiſts then Living, and the extirpation of their Principles, out of theſe Kingdoms for ever. And all this being ſetled by Law,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97114:34"/>there is no place for the moderation of any particular men, either Biſhops towards the Non-Conformiſts, nor of Non-Conformiſts themſelves that could go a great way towards conformity, if they could not do all that was enjoyned therefore the breach is irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable, and not to be made up, unleſs God incline King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to take away theſe bones of Contention.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nothing therefore now remains for the Non-Conformiſts, but that either they ſet ſtill as private men, and dye in ſilence, or elſe that they exerciſe their Miniſtry againſt the Law, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations diſtinct from the Pariſh Churches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dr</hi> would perſwade them to do the former, and that they ſin againſt their own Principles and Conſciences, if they do the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But he muſt give us leave to declare our own Principles, and then were are ready to hear what conſequences he can draw from them againſt our practiſe.</p>
               <p>The Non-Conformiſts own theſe Principles as to the matter in hand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That their ejection out of their Livings and Miniſtry was very unjuſt, both in the thing it ſelf, they having not deſerved it of the Church or State, and in the manner of proceeding, they being ejected not for any errour in Doctrine, or offence in manners, but only Terms were deviſed, which their Oppoſites knew, they could not ſubmit to, and impoſed on them on purpoſe to turn them out of their Miniſtry for refuſing them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are ſatisifed that the turning out of ſo great a number of pious and diligent Miniſters at once, was a very great prejudice to the Church of God at home, Prophanes, Popery, Atheiſm, and all that is evil preſently breaking in upon her as a floud, and a great ſcandal to the Churches abroad, to ſee their Brethren of the ſame principles ſo dealt with by Proteſtants, for no other reaſon but for holding and endeavouring the ſame things, that all reformed Churches generally do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Being unjuſtly ejected, their are ſatisfied that they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forfeited their Miniſtry, and therefore ought not to lay it down nor loſt their right to their people and Congregations any more then a Civil Magiſtrate driven out by an Uſurper, and excluded by Laws, looſeth his Native Right to his People and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The people greatly wanting their Miniſtry, they are ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that as they have a right to their Congregations, ſo they ought to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97114:35"/>make uſe of it for the peoples good, where they deſire it, and will accept it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They alſo believe that Miniſters having not given any juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for their ejection, the People ought to ſtick to them, and to oppoſe any that ſhall come in their room, on the account of this Act as Intruders and Uſurpers, unleſs ſpecial reaſons alter the caſe in ſome places, and as to ſome perſons. Thus the Orthodox gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally did when turned out by <hi>Arian</hi> Emperours, and <hi>Arians</hi> ſent in their room, the Miniſters cleaved to their people, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to them: They cauſe alters not the eaſe here, they did it againſt Law, and that which warranted them, will warrant our Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts with advantage.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They believe that thoſe Congregations thus deprived of their Miniſters, may chuſe other Non-conformiſts if they cannot have their own, or may chuſe others in their room after they are dead, and that they ought to do ſo, unleſs in ſingular caſes, becauſe elſe they looſe their undoubted priviledge of chooſing their Miniſters, and lay themſelves open to a perpetual uſurpation, to have their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters torn from them, and others impoſed on them at the pleaſure of Superiours, and alſo they do at leaſt tacitly conſent to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this ejection of their Miniſters, ſubverſion of Reformation, and eſtabliſhment of Conformity for ever.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They believe that the people of <hi>England</hi> having been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally engaged to, and active for reformation with the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and againſt Conformity leſs then is now eſtabliſhed, and having felt the benefit of it, are obliged each one in their place to oppoſe and teſtify againſt this rigorous Conformity, and not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, and that otherwiſe they diſown their own former works, and their Miniſters, and give themſelves and their liberties in Church matters, and their Conſciences all-together into the hands of Church Uſurpers, when ever they can prevail with the Civil Magiſtrate to joyn with them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And that therefore the people who are ſenſible of this great Uſurpation, and of the great blow given to the Church by it, and how juſt the cauſe of the Non-Conformiſts is, ought on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to own both them and their miniſtry, as there is occaſion, though they never were their proper Paſtours, for the Communion of Saints extendeth to owning of their ſufferings and themſelves in them, when they are for the ſame general or more particular cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:97114:35"/>
               <p n="9">9. They are ſure that the Miniſters and Peoples adhereing to each other in ſuch a caſe is agreeable to Scripture, which makes Mininiſters the ſole Governours of the Church, as it is a ſpiritual Common-Wealth under Chriſt, and gives the people the ſole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of gathering themſelves into Congregations for their own beſt edification, and to chuſe their own Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And they are ſure that the practiſe is agreeable to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Univerſal Church both before and after they were under Chriſtian Magiſtrates, till the Pope at once wreſted from the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates their ſupream power in their Dominions, and from the Churches all their authority of Governing themſelves, and as the ruine of Religion followed thereupon in the Church, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſed of by the Luſts of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo there would be no way to prevent the like, ſhould all be left to the wills of the Civil Magiſtrate, or a few Church men that guide and influence him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As a people under Uſupers in their Civil-Rights may and ought to provide what they can for their own liberties and ſafety, till they can recover their ancient priviledges and rightfull Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, ſtill doing nothing againſt the publick good, ſo they think the people of <hi>England</hi> being under great uſurpation and oppreſſion in Eccleſiaſtical Government, are bound to provide the beſt they can for their own Souls, and the Principle Ends of a Church, till Right and Truth may take place, ſtill having reſpect to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good and peace of the Church.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe principles many Non-conformiſts ſtill keep to their own Congregations, ſome gather new ones, and become Paſtors to them, and ſome preach to Aſſemblies of people, that voluntarily come to hear them, without taking full paſtoral charge of them; yet all maintain a brotherly communion with the Pariſhes and Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not forbiding their people to hear and own them as brethren, and occaſionally at leaſt, to hold Communion with them in all things that are not againſt their Conſciences. Now if from theſe principles, or this practiſe the Dr. can convince the Non-conformiſts of Schiſme, or ſinful ſeperation or allowing that in the people which they are not ſatisfied in themſelves, They would gladly accept his endeavours herein, but will not be concerned with ſuch that have ſold their Conſciences to get a poor livelihood, by defending what ever the Rulers ſay or do.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> An Anſwer to ſome paſſages in the Drs Sermon, tending to prove the Non-conformiſts Preaching to be Schiſme by their own Principles.</head>
               <p>VVE will now briefly conſider what the Dr. Rhetorically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates, rather then argues againſt the Non conformiſts preaching in private, though they are driven out of the Churches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To object That they acknowledge the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be true in Doctrine, Sacraments and Worſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 21. 2. That the Pariſhes of <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt ſome of them are true Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is lawful to hold Communion with them ſometimes, and upon occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. All this will prove no more than that the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts ought not to unchurch the Pariſhes of <hi>England,</hi> or to account their Miniſters and Sacraments Null, or to diſown the people to be their brethren, as ſome of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> are ſaid to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Dr hath given much occaſion in his Writings, to many to think, that he granteth as much of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as he here ſaith, the Non-conformiſts do, of the Church of <hi>England, viz.</hi> that it is true in Doctrine, Sacraments, and Worſhip, that the Pariſhes are true Churches, and that it is ſimply lawful to hold occaſional communinon with them, for they have the true Doctrine, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and worſhip, for the ſubſtantials of them, though defaced in circumſtances and many corruptions added to them, yet he will not ſay that it was not lawful, yea neceſſary to break off from her, and to oppoſe her.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The queſtion betwixt the Dr. and the Non-conformiſts is whether the Non-conforming Miniſters and people are bound ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bear the uſurpation of the Biſhops over them, in impoſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and un-neceſſary things upon them, and caſting them out of the Church for non ſubmiſſion, and not rather, both to aſſert their own Rights and Priviledges againſt ſuch uſurpation? The Pariſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true Churches, and occaſional communion in unqueſtionable
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97114:36"/>things being lawful, is nothing to this purpoſe. And if the Non-conformiſts are more charitable and fair towards the Conformiſts (who are the great Schiſme makers, by their rigorous impoſitions of things they confeſs un-neceſſary) than the Conformiſts are to them, who are paſſive in the breach, and yet they will hold no Communion with them; They think this ſhould not be made an argument againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 30. 4. The Dr. hath cited a pertinent example, though he thought to anticipate us in it. The people of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> he ſaith when <hi>Chryſostome</hi> their Biſhop was thruſt out and baniſhed for doing his duty, and <hi>Arſaeius</hi> impoſed on them in his room, refuſed to joyn with him; This is the Non-conformiſts caſe. But ſaith he, when <hi>Atticus</hi> reſtored <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s name to the Dipticks of the Church, then they returned to their ancient Communion, and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> advized them to it. And when the Biſhops will acknowledge as <hi>Atticus</hi> here did, that the Non-conformiſts were wronged, and thoſe that were put in their places were intruders, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently take off the yoke of Conformity, then they will do as the people of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did, till then this example juſtifies the Non-conformiſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though the Non-conformiſts allow Pariſh Congregations, and the Pariſhes of <hi>England</hi> not to be diſowned on that account, from being true Churches, yet the Dr. knows, that thoſe very men whom he quotes as moſt complying with him, do deny thoſe Pariſhes to be true Organical Churches, whoſe Miniſters have not power of Governing their people, or ought for their Doctrines and lives to be expelled the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Non-conformiſts do not ſay, it is lawful to hold occaſional Communion in all things with the Pariſhes, but only in the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of worſhip; nor with all Pariſhes, but with thoſe only where they may joyn with ſome edification. And becauſe wiſe and learned men can diſtinguiſh the good from the evil, they may joyn with many Miniſters occaſionally when the people may not, for fear of their errours or becauſe of their railing and reproaches of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren or Godlineſs, by which this people will either be infected or diſturbed, ſo that they can receive no benefit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Dr. Argues, If occaſional Communion be Lawful, it is hard to underſtand that conſtant Communion ſhould not be a Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I allow him to mean amongſt us who were once fellow Members of the ſame Pariſhes, elſe his words have no force.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97114:37"/>But the Non-Conformiſts allow of Occaſional Communion to maintain Love and Peace amongſt the People, and Miniſters that are peaceable, and to ſhew that they do not eſteem the Impoſitions of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be of ſo high a Nature as the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they ſhould break off all Communion from them. But if the ejected Miniſters have ſtill aright to their people, and the people to them, and both are bound to oppoſe in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Uniformity impoſed with ſuch Circumſtances as it is, and as they maintain; it will not at all follow that from occaſional Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communion, they muſt become conſtant Members of the Pariſhes, and be content with their Communion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Dr. frequently hints Authority and Government to which we muſt be ſubject, and therefore if they eject Miniſters, they muſt become Lay-men, and not Preach, In this he ſpeaks ſometimes of the Authority of the Church, and ſometimes of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And becauſe this is a ſnare to many mens Conſciences, We anſwer freely.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Authority of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as a Church hath no Obligation on the Conſciences of Non-Conformiſts any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then prudence and peace doth direct them; for the Biſhops, Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Rulers of it, ſuppoſing them Lawful, yet being no way choſen by the People or Inferiour Clergy, can have no Lawful Eccleſiaſtical Authority over this Church, eſpecially being alwaies proteſted againſt by a conſiderable part of the Miniſters and People; nor can the Lyturgy, or any thing elſe they impoſe oblige the Miniſters and People, being not advized with in ſuch Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor heard ſpeak for themſelves. Two Thouſand Miniſters as Orthodox diligent learned, and every way conſiderable, as their Oppoſites, and pleading for no other things then many ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have pleaded for, from the beginning of our Reformation, are not therefore bound in Conſcience to ſubmit to the Wills of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, becauſe they prevailed with the Civil Power to eſtabliſh their Opinion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Civil Magiſtrate hath Power to maintain and protect the Church, and to ſee that ſhe doth her Duty, but to impoſe forms of Worſhip on her, without the advice, and againſt the conſent of thoſe who are moſt concern'd: He hath no power given him of God; much leſs to infringe her Priviledges and Liberties, to rend away her Paſtors at pleaſure, or to impoſe whom he pleaſe on her,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97114:37"/>and the like; And where there is no Authority to command, that command cannot oblige to obedience: Indeed where ſmall things are enjoyned that are not ſinful, men may obey, if prudential Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons lead them to it; But if ſmall things will uſher in great ones, and obedience will make way for more impoſition. It was the Apoſtles Judgment in a like caſe concerning the practiſe of the Jewiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that ſuch Impoſers ſhould be reſiſted. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Should our King of himſelf impoſe a Tax of a Farthing Pole, would not many ſuſpect, it might if peaceably paid, make way for greater Taxes, and ſo undermine their Liberties in Parliament? Why ſhould not men be as jealous of the Liberties and Priuiledges of the Church, which concern the Honour of Chriſt, and their own Souls good, eſpecially knowing that the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church was ruined and defaced by the Pope, meerly by yielding and patient bearing of gradual Impoſitions and encroachments in the better ſort; and the worſer ſort complying, and crying for Obedience to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church and Governours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 19. 4. The Dr. ſaith that we confeſs the caſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is very different from that of the Miniſters, and therefore that they run into Schiſm in hearing us, though we for ſome Siniſter ends will not tell them of their errour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Intereſt and paſſion will not ſuffer men to ſpeak of ſuch things as they are concerned in, without uncharitable and un-ſcholer like reflections ſometimes, which I will pity, rather then retort; And to the thing, we anſwer, That the Peoples caſe is indeed much different from the Miniſters, as to Active Conformity, <hi>i. e.</hi> They are not to Aſſent or Conſent to all in the Service Book, nor to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe as the Miniſters muſt, in order to their holding Communion, but paſſively the people are concerned as far as the Miniſters, <hi>i. e.</hi> They are to ſuffer all theſe things; Their Miniſters to be caſt out, and all Impoſitions which they and their Fathers groaned under, to be enjoyned with the greateſt rigour, and not ſhew their diſlike of any of them, upon pain of being accounted Schiſmaticks, according to the 27 <hi>Canon.</hi> So that the people are as much wronged, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on in their Capacities, as the Miniſters are in theirs; We grant that the People may hear and ſee thoſe things done in Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſo may Miniſters alſo as private men, which conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters ought not to be active in. As our Saviour was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Temple Worſhip, though there were many Superſtitions mixed by the Prieſts in thoſe days, but what men may do in ſome
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97114:38"/>caſes, they are not obliged to do in all caſes, and people cannot be obliged to ſuffer any ſinfull or doubtfull things in the worſhip they joyn in, unleſs there be ſome great reaſon why they may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that worſhip; Now the Non-Conformiſts affirm that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are obliged in their capacities to endeavour reformation of things amiſs in the Church, and to own that Reformation they had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to withſtand the unjuſt intolerable impoſition of the laſt uniformity, as much as the Miniſters are to do; all theſe in their places. And therefore as it is no Schiſm for the Miniſters to preach, ſo neither is it any for the people to hear. That we may plainly expreſs the ſence of the Non-Conformiſts in this point, and that the <hi>Dr</hi> may no more miſtake their Principles, and ſo labour in vain to convince them. They ſay as <hi>Harnbeck</hi> adviſeth the <hi>Caborniſt:</hi> in reference to the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> That good and peaceable men of each party ſhould love each other, and hold as much Brotherly Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion together as may be, but no more to endeavour any publick Reconciliation or Union, which the Heads and Leaders of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have ſo often fruſtrated and oppoſed, till God will give them a more Moderate Spirit, and ſome fit reaſon may incline them to Union. The Queſtion betwixt them and the <hi>Dr</hi> plainly is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether a multitude of Miniſters being turned out of the Church to her great and apparent damage, without ſo much as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging any Crime againſt them, but only impoſing new things on them, on purpoſe to enſnare them, whether theſe Miniſters are bound to lay down their Miniſtry and live private, and not rather to aſſert their own and the Churches Rights?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the People thus wrongfully deprived of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and impoſed upon alſo, againſt their own Judgments and Conſcience, in matters of Divine worſhip, whether they are bound to ſubmit to the Intruders and Impoſers, and not rather to joyn with their injured Miniſters, in aſſerting their own priviledges? The <hi>Dr</hi>'s candour is too great to deny, that the reaſon of Scripture and the practiſe of the beſt antiquity, before the Churches loſt their juſt liberty, is on the Non-Conformiſts ſide in theſe points.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether the Non-Conformiſts both Miniſters and People are not greatly ſtrengthened both in their Non-Conformity to the Lyturgy, and alſo in their practiſe of holding Communion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſelf preſervation, by what hath followed in an un-interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe, ever ſince the ejection of Miniſters, <hi>viz,</hi> the horrible and general contempt of Religion, general corruption of manners,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97114:38"/>great neglect of preaching to the people, moſt Dignitaries having many Pariſhes in their hands, which they ſupply by ignorant boys; the great growth of Popery, with a certain and manifeſt deſign of bringing it into the Land again, if his Majeſty who now letteth were taken out of the way, the great corruption of Doctrine as well as manners in our own Clergy, neither of which are minded by the Rulers of our Church, ſo as man be conformable; that it is now in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as in that of <hi>Rome,</hi> men may be of any opinion, live in any vice, or be of no Religion, ſo they own the Pope and his Church, and be no Proteſtants; ſo here men may be Arminian, Socinian, Papiſts, Atheiſts, and what they will ſo they externally conform to the Lyturgy, and be no Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſo that it is now manifeſt, that nothing was intended by the contrivers of the Act of Uniformity, but to caſt out of the Miniſtry thoſe whom they knew could not then conform, and for ever to keep out, and intangle the moſt underſtanding and conſcientious men, and to let none into the Church, who ſhould ſcruple any of her commands or practiſes. Are ſuch things any motives to the Non-Conformiſts after 18 years ſuffering all the indignities and injuries that <hi>Julian's</hi> wit and malice thought fit to lay upon the Chriſtians of his time, and ſuppoſed them more intollerable to them then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death, which would have been both honourable, and an end of their miſeries. I ſay are theſe things motives, that at laſt they ſhould condemn their former practiſe, and without any relaxation quietly take all the Burthen on their Shoulders? no, they are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath given her ſelf a mortal wound by her Act of Uniformity, and hath layn bleeding of it ever ſince almoſt to death, that they ought not to haſten her death, by putting their hands and adding their helps to it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is the ſame neceſſity of the Miniſtry to preſerve, build up, and continue the Church, by adding new Members through the preaching of the word, as there was of the Apoſtles to lay the foundation of the Church, and therefore there lay's the ſame neceſſity upon every Miniſter to preach to his flock within his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, as did on the Apoſtles in their Compaſs. May Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates be reſiſted, or depoſed, by the people upon any pretence, and

The Dr. ſaith the Aſſembly of Divines gave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weighty Reaſons againſt Toleration, and were for Uniformity as much as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> So that, that Church is juſtified by them from all Tyranny in exacting Uniformity; and the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, whether there ſhall be a Uiniformity, but who ſhall have the ordering of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The preſent Non-conformiſts have oppoſed Toleration of all Sects and Opinions, as much as the Aſſembly, but this charge is a great injury both to the Aſſembly and to the Nonconformiſts now living; for the Aſſembly never deſired Uniformity in the ſame words of Prayer, and all Divine Offices, or in Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies deviſed by men that might occaſion ſcruple to any, nor do their reaſons tend to any ſuch thing, but only that men ſhould not have liberty to withdraw from their Pariſhes upon every pretence, and to conſtitute new Congregations. The preſent Non-conformiſts deſire no Uniformity but in Doctrine and the ſubſtantials of worſhip, Diſcipline and Government, leaving the wording and methoding of worſhip to particular mens prudence, and the neceſſities of their people, and leaving all Congregations to their liberties in Rites and Ceremonies, not inſtituted by Chriſt; ſuppoſing that Phyſitians may as well be tied to the ſame rules in adminiſtring Phyſick to all bodies; as Miniſters and people be obliged to the ſame words, and things, univerſally for their ſouls.</p>
               <p>[Let the late Act of Uniformity be aboliſhed, the Apocryphal books and Holidayes be left out of the Lyturgy, and the Pſalms read in the new Tranſlation; let the Croſs and Surplice be taken away, and kneeling at the Sacrament be left indifferent, according to the diſcretion of Miniſters, and the deſires of the people; alſo let Parents ſtipulate for their own children, and ſome few things in the Prayers be altered, or ſo explained, that they may give no offence; let the book of Conſecration of Biſhops, &amp;c, be reſtored as it was in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, and Miniſters be bound only in general words to a peaceable ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> &amp; let them ſubſcribe

               <p>
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 11, 12. But the Dr. ſaith <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. Commands all to walk by the ſame Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rule of Uniformity formerly given them, when the Apoſtle was with them, as they were wont to do in all the Churches.</p>
               <p>Be it ſo, but did the Apoſtle intend any more then that they ſhould be content with the ſame ſubſtantials of worſhip which were for common edification, wherein all might and ought to agree without contending about the Ceremonies of the Law, or particular opinions, which ſome out of weakneſs might be zealous for, and others that were more perfect knew were aboliſhed. This ſeems to be the plain meaning of the Text; for both the perfect and the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and otherwiſe minded, were all to agree in the practiſe of this Rule, which therefore could not be the impoſition or limitation of diſputable Doctrines, or queſtionable Rites and Ceremonies, but he would prove that this Uniformity was in Rites and Ceremonies from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. becauſe ſome things the Apoſtle ordained in all Churches; but the Text ſpeaks only of the Co-habitation of Husbands and wives, when one was an Infidel, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. Was this a Ceremony? In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34. The Apoſtle aboliſheth the cuſtom of Love-feaſts before the Lords Supper, becauſe it was abuſed, and was of no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; what then? <hi>Ergo,</hi> he ordained Uniformity of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The Apoſtle adds, <hi>the reſt will I ſet in order when I come,</hi> i. e. <hi>other diſorders among them the Apoſtle would regulate;</hi> And there is no way to reform abuſes in the Church, but by impoſing un-neceſſary Ceremonies?</p>
               <p>He ſaith <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. That the Apoſtles gave Rules concerning Rites and Cuſtomes, wherein there was doubt and ſcruple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But what were they? To impoſe Rites upon men who ſcruple the lawfulneſs of them? if ſo, the people might have took their word (who were infallible) what Rites were lawful, and what not; but no Church Governors have that Authority now, but on the contrary, the Apoſtles forbade thoſe who were zealous for Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, to impoſe them upon others, and commanded thoſe who knew their liberty in ſuch Ceremonies, not to uſe their liberty to the offence or diſturbance of thoſe who contended for them.</p>
               <p>In a word, The Apoſtles commanded that every man ſhould
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97114:40"/>uſe his own judgment, and liberty in things indifferent, privately and peaceably without impoſing upon, or cenſuring each other; and that all things ſhould be done for edifying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>per totum;</hi> and this is directly againſt the Uniformity of Ceremonies, or the impoſing of any uncommanded Ceremony upon the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apparent neceſſity, general conſent, and a proſpect of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ariſe thereby.</p>
               <p>Thus we have exonerated our Conſciences of the guilt of Schiſm, at leaſt voluntary, and againſt our knowledge. Let the Dr. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly look to his Conſcience, for charging us with Schiſm, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Separation againſt our own profeſſed principles, before the Judges of the Land, and the chief Magiſtrates of <hi>London,</hi> without any proof, and at a time when he knoweth the Papiſts hope to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us and our Religion, by turning the Magiſtrates ſword, and opening the peoples mouthes againſt the Non-conformiſts.</p>

               <p>I Come now to conſider what the Dr. hath further ſaid in his large defence of his Sermon, to make good the Charge of Schiſm, or ſinful Separation againſt the Non-Conformiſts. The Dr. proceeds in an Hiſtorical way, and therefore is prolix. I ſhall according to my firſt intention (which was to give the Reaſons of the Non-Conformiſts practiſe in preaching, (though forbidden by Law) proceed to examine what the Dr. hath further ſaid to invalidate thoſe Reaſons; and to vindicate them from ſuch exceptions as he hath made againſt them, and therefore I ſhall only take notice of ſuch things as are matter of Argument, which will be reduced to a few heads, and paſs by all perſonal matters, as alſo his long Preface, and all Reflections on times and perſons which are forreign, to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hand. The Diſpute being about a matter of practiſe, and of a publick concern, the only end of writing, ſhould be either to find out the Truth by debateing it calmly, or elſe if neither ſide can change the others judgment, yet to produce ſuch probable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for their Opinion and Practice, as may ſatisfie impartial Men, that they act not from raſhneſs, or for ſiniſter ends, but as becomes Men, that conſider conſcientiouſly what they do, and why they do it. But before I come to his firſt Argument, I think it of great moment to take notice of what he chargeth the Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts with in general, <hi>viz.</hi> their approving an univerſal Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97114:41"/>Toleration of all Sects and Opinions under the Notion of Liberty of Conſcience, which he proves by their accepting Lycenſes to Preach according to the Kings Proclamation, 1672. to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, We are not to take all that is written by men in diſtreſs for their ſetled Judgment, much leſs for the Judgment of the whole Party.</p>
               <p>The Dr. would think it hard that Biſhop <hi>Tailors</hi> Book for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of propheſying, and others of that kind, written by Epiſcopal men under oppreſſion and reſtraint, ſhould be charged to be the judgment of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Toleration and Liberty of Conſcience was the brat of <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi> in <hi>Switzerland, Poland,</hi> and afterwards foſtered by the <hi>Dutch-Arminians,</hi> and was ever deteſted by the <hi>Non-Conformiſts.</hi> It is their general ſence that they would rather dye in ſilence and obſcurity then Papiſts, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and other dangerous Sects ſhould have immunity, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of favour to them: But they were advized to accept of the Licenſes granted by that Declaration, becauſe it ſtraitly forbid all their private Meetings, Commanded to ſet open their Doors, and not to preſume to Preach without ſuch Licenſes firſt obtained, They Preached, and did all the ſame things in private before which now the Declaration gave them leave to do in publick, VVould it not have been look'd upon as a rude contempt of the Magiſtrates favour, and a giving a juſt cauſe of jealouſie to the State if they had ſtill kept private Meetings, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be publick, and to receive the Magiſtrates allowance and protection: We never pleaded for Liberty of thinking, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpeaking, or acting in Religion as every man pleaſeth, under the name of the Liberty of Conſcience; Conſcience is bound to the revealed will of God at its only Rule, and is only to be free where God hath left it free; <hi>i. e.</hi> in things not clearly revealed, or not commarided by him, either directly, or by juſt Conſequence. We plead for no Liberty but that wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, that we may not be again intangled in a yoke of Bondage to thoſe things which Chriſt hath neither commanded, nor given men leave to command, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. Nor ſhould it have been forgotten that the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> Friends in the Parliament, were the chief Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of recalling that Declaration, which was no ſign that the whole Party approved of Toleration. But why do we ſtill Preach? The Reaſons are given partly before, and ſhall be more hereafter. But come we now to the Arguments, the firſt is this;</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:97114:41"/>
               <p>§ 1. 2. The terms of Communion are the ſame now as they were at the firſt Reformation, and if they were no juſt ground of Separation then, neither are they now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We muſt Remember the queſtion before us, and the <hi>Dr</hi> propoſed to handle in his Sermon, and in his Letter to Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> is barely this, <hi>whether the Non-conformiſt Miniſters ejected by the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, are bound to ſit down as Lay-men in the Pariſhes they live in, and not to preach or act as Miniſters on pain of incurring the guilt of Schiſm.</hi> This he leaveth and runneth into the large Field of Separation from the Communion of the Church, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the buſineſs, for if it were granted that the Non-Conformiſts were bound to all acts of Communion with the Pariſhes, when they preach not themſelves, as the Non-Reſident Conformiſts are in the places where they live, yet it will not follow from hence, that they muſt forbear all exerciſes of their Miniſtry, and to be content with the Lay-Communion of the Pariſhes any more then the Non-Reſidents may plead that they cannot reſide with their own people, or perform Miniſterial duties to them, becauſe they muſt hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them amongſt whom they dwell.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Dr</hi> in all his book hath ſaid nothing directly to the queſtion in hand, <hi>but the Terms of Communion he ſaith are the ſame now as at the firſt Reformation,</hi> but as to the Miniſters, this is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently otherwiſe, ſuch Subſcriptions and Declarations being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them as no Hiſtory can match, except thoſe impoſed on the <hi>Janſenists</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> of which ours ſeem to be an immitation. The contrivers of our impoſitions being then in <hi>France,</hi> when the <hi>Janſenists</hi> were removed from all Eccleſiaſtical Places by a like arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as we afterwards were: If he mean the Terms of Communion that concern the people, as he elſewhere expreſſeth himſelf, and reſtrains them to the Terms impoſed by Law, this is nothing to the purpoſe for the Miniſters, though they ſhould ſubmit to thoſe terms when they act as private men, may nevertheleſs be bound not to for ſake the exerciſe of their Miniſtry. Beſides there is a Fallacy in reſtraining the Terms to thoſe enjoyned by Law; what if neither Miniſters nor people can enjoy the benefit of the Law, but new terms are impoſed on them without Law, as were the ſubſcription to the Service Book, <hi>Can.</hi> 36. whereby ſo many worthy Miniſters were turned out in K. <hi>Jame</hi>'s time, the Reading of the book for Soorts on the Lords Day, and the Reading of the Prayer againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the order for Preaching but once a Sabbath, and then
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97114:42"/>not to exceed an hour, for diſobeying which more were rejected in the late King's time, and many ſuch are ſtill continued, <hi>viz,</hi> the conſtant Reading of the Communion Service, though there be no Sacrament, which makes the Prayers more tedious, and fuller of Repitions then they need to be, and alſo ſtraitneth the Preacher, if it do not hinder the Sermon, the placeing the Communion Table and Railing it like an Altar, and compelling the Communicants to come up by parcels to kneel before it contrary to Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: muſt the people ſubmit ſtill, becauſe theſe things are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Law; do not innovations and corruptions come into the Church by degrees, and by connivance at firſt; and afterwards when their Authors are ſtrong enough, they are then eſtabliſhed by Laws and Canons: And yet the Argument holdeth not, the things impoſed might be ſubmitted to at the firſt Reformation, <hi>ergo</hi> they muſt be ſo ſtill.</p>
               <p>The Jewiſh Ceremonies were tolerated and practiſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the beginning of the Goſpel, and yet when falſe teachers, and other peeviſh or timorous men contended for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them ſtill, when the reaſon of it, <hi>viz,</hi> not offending the <hi>Jews</hi> was ceaſed, and they were an hindrance to the Goſpel then the ſame Apoſtle would not give place to them, no not for an hour, though <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> joyned with them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3.4.5. and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to the 18. Nor doth our practiſe reflect on our firſt Reformers, unleſs they had been extraordinarily inſpired to that work, then indeed to vary from them, or endeavour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, would be to reproach the Spirit by whom they acted. But if they made that Reformation only as good and wiſe men, acting according to Principles of Piety and Prudence, as farr as they could in their circumſtances, it is no diſparagement to them, if others vary from them according to the times and circumſtanees they live in. My L. <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves that in civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters our Parliament does dayly alter our Laws,<note place="margin">Bacon<hi>'s</hi> Eſſays,</note> and ſuit them to the preſent times and caſe of the people, yet this is thought no diſparagement to the Wiſdom or Juſtice of their Anceſtours in former Parliaments, but the Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>eth almoſt buried in the Rubbiſh of time, and this muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of Veneration, forſooth, to Antiquity.</p>
               <p>The beſt men not inſpired can but do what is beſt for their own time, we ſhould therefore inquire not only whether the terms of Communion be the ſame now, that they were at the firſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97114:42"/>but alſo whether thoſe terms be as neceſſary as Tolerable, and as fit to be ſubmitted to now as they wre then; Nor did our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers expect that their endeavours ſhould be made an unalterable Standard to all poſterity.</p>
               <p>The expreſt in their Preface to the Common-Prayer Book their mind this purpoſe, <hi>viz. That they had done what they could in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church and the Liturgy, according to their light, and as their times would bear, and that they hoped thoſe that came after would be able to do more, and go further:</hi> This I have heard from divers Ancient and Credible Perſons, who remembred they had read this paſſage in the ſaid Preface, though it be now left out: And it is the more unreaſonable to urge the platform of the firſt Reformation as a Rule not to be altered, though in diſputable and mutable things, becauſe ſome of theſe Reformers, both Miniſters and People of that time diſliked ſome things that were impoſed, and becauſe they were yoked with ſome Papiſts, who diſſembled their Religion that they might both keep their places, and more effectually hinder the Reformation, as Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> is ſaid to have complained, How ever the thing was an unqueſtionable Truth: Nor is it altogether true, which he ſaith, that the diſlike of our Liturgy or Ceremonies was wholly brought from abroad by <hi>Hooper, Rogers,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch as had travelled in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Helvetia,</hi> where <hi>Cranmer</hi> himſelf had alſo been a conſiderable time; But it ſprang up at home alſo, together with the firſt ſeeds of the Reformation. Almongſt <hi>Wicklif</hi>'s Opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> and charged on him by his Adverſaries, there by many pieces of the preſent <hi>Non-Con-formity,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Diſcipline and Ceremonies,<note place="margin">*Church Hiſt.

Henry 8th.</hi> many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were complained of in the Convocation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now common among the People as againſt <hi>Lent,</hi> moſt of the Ceremonies and ſuch like. It is natural for Chriſtians not only to deſire to hear true Doctrine, and to have true Worſhip, but to have that Doctrine and worſhip maintained by ſuch Diſcipline, and expreſſed by ſuch Ceremonies or Circumſtances as are allowed by it, and agreeable to it, and not by exotick things of mans device, and humour, It is true, then, Conformity and Non-conformity were Twins, conceived and Born together in the Womb of our Church, and it is as true that Non-Conformity put forth its hand firſt, though Conformity had the hap firſt to break, and to be Midwifed into into the world by Law.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:97114:43"/>
               <p>But indeed is it a Reflection on our firſt Reformers to deſire to mend, what they were not peremptory in, and ſome of them diſliked? And is it no diſhonour to them to change the Doctrine then eſtabliſht, in chief Articles of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> points, which have ſo long reigned amongſt us? And concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine right of Biſhops above Presbyters which they ſo expreſly diſavowed, both in their printed books, and in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of divers queſtions decided by them the account whereof we owe to this Learned man?<note place="margin">Irenic p. <hi>2.</hi> and laſt.</note> All this therefore from the honour of our Reformers is but a flouriſh.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. We have three Reaſons given why our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers left ſuch Ceremonies in the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith it was out of Reverence to Antiquity, they being of uſe in the Primitive times, long before Popery, and yet three of the chief Men, <hi>Peter Martyr, Martyn Bucer, Paulus Fagius,</hi> who were ſent from beyond Sea to aſſiſt in the Reformation, promoted no ſuch continuance of theſe venerable Antiquities in the Churches abroad, where they had been made uſe of before to help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: And how Ancient were theſe Ceremonies? Why? the Surplice he ſaith was uſed in <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Hieroms</hi> time, that was 400 years after Chriſt, and Superſtition came in apace, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Churches, and praying for and to the Dead, and ſuch like; And Ceremonies were ſo many that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complained of the condition of the Church in his time in that regard, was worſe, then that of the Church under the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Sacrament he ſaith was received about</hi> Conſtantines <hi>time in a poſture of Adoration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That was ſtanding <hi>Sc.</hi> from the time of <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> as all other publick Worſhip was then performed in remembrance of Chriſts Reſurrection. But did they kneel? The Dr. will not ſay ſo, nor can he produce any evidence, that kneeling at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was commonly uſed, till divers Hundred years after Popery had defiled the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church. <hi>The Croſs he ſaith was much Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter, and uſed with much Superſtition even in</hi> Tertullian<hi>'s time;</hi> but the Dr. ſaith not, it was uſed in Baptiſm, nor is there any proof of it, and that was only to our caſe. <hi>When he pleads that we need not reform beyond the example of the Primitive times,</hi> viz: <hi>thoſe ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apostles, and ſaith it gives great advantage to the Papiſts, to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97114:43"/>to reject the Customs of thoſe times upon pretence that the Miſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity was working even in the Apoſtles daies.</hi> I deſire to know where we ſhall ſtop, and what Church ſhall we take for our pattern? Do all, did any, of the Churches for the firſt 300 years uſe our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in their publick Church Service? or if they did, were not others alſo uſed in many Churches, now generally diſallowed by Papiſts and Proteſtants. <hi>As giving the Communion to Infants, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eulogies or conſecrated Bread to thoſe that were abſent from the Sacrament and the like.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> no <hi>Non-Conformiſt,</hi> hath prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Saints and Image Worſhip in remoter and ſmaller degrees, began very early in the Church, amongſt which he reckons the moſt Ancient uſe of the Croſs in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, with which they uſe to fortifie themſelves againſt the Devil and all evil Accidents.</p>
               <p>There were never more Hereſies and Diviſions in the Church,<note place="margin">Apoſt. of the latter times.</note> then in the Primitive times. Yea, before the Apoſtles were dead, there have been no Errours or Corruptions ſince, but the like were then, and muſt we not go beyond or paſs by all theſe times, and appeal only to Scripture as the only Rule for Conſtituring and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Church? Did the Judges or Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> that reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Church before the Captivity, or <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> after it, ever make former times their Preſident? Did they not alwaies appeal to the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> If we muſt ſuppoſe the times next the Apoſtles had their Cuſtoms, and Ceremonies from the Apoſtles, becauſe they lived ſo near them, This opens a door to all Popiſh Traditions, and overthrows the perfection of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Or if we ſuppoſe the preſent Church in every Age hath not as much Power of ſelf-Government as the Primitive Church had, or to appoint and alter their own Cuſtomes and Ceremonies, we ſhall contradict our <hi>20th. Artic.</hi> and bring our ſelves into unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſlavery to all the Cannons and Cuſtomes of all former times; and ſo the Chriſtians as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> will need a Talmud beſides their Bible. It is probable our firſt Reformers, ſeeing they muſt retain ſome Ceremonies, retained thoſe they thought moſt Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and leaſt offenſive, and this was the Reaſon why they were retained, and not laid aſide.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Dr. ſaith, Theſe Ceremonies were retained for fear of the Popiſh Biſhops, who were ſome of them Learned Men, leaſt they ſhould reproach the Reformers with innovation againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive as well as the Popiſh Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was indeed the true and chief reaſon why our Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formations
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97114:44"/>was no more compleat becauſe the Popiſh Biſhops that were joyned with the Reformers hindred them, and the Popiſh People would not endure a through Reformation: Mr. <hi>John Elliot</hi> a worthy Gentleman in the Parliament, <hi>Ann.</hi> 3. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. ſaid, That he had ſeen in a <hi>Diary</hi> written with K. <hi>Edw. 6th.</hi> own hand,<note place="margin">Ruſhw.

                  </note> theſe words. That the Biſhops at that time, ſome for Ignorance, ſome for Sloath, ſome for Pride and Luxury, and ſome for Popery, were unfit for Diſcipline: To which we muſt add, that ſome of the good Biſhops, Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> in particular, being but late Converts from Popery, had yet a Zeal for the old Cuſtomes and Ceremonies, thoſe that could be retained without manifeſt Superſtition. And ſo much they themſelues acknowledge in the Preface to the Service Book before cited; Now what Obligation is this upon us, not to endeavour a further Reformation?</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſaith, They had reſpect to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, who retained the ſame and more Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They might conſider that ſeeing they muſt retain ſome of the old Cuſtomes, it would be more excuſable to retain theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome other Proteſtant Churches did retain them: But that they did it in imitation of thoſe Churches there is no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; ſeeing till now our Church was alwaies charged to be too much addicted to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and influenced by him and <hi>Beza,</hi> both in K. <hi>Edw.</hi> and Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> time. Nor is there any Reaſon why the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves retained ſo much, many Popiſh Ceremonies, but becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> being almoſt wholy intent upon reforming the Doctrine of the Church, neglected matters of Diſcipline and Ceremonies, which his Followers interpret his judgment; So hard, is it to make any Progreſs in any good deſign, eſpecially in matters of Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the firſt Efforts, when mens firſt Affections and Zeal are cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the World with carnal ſelf doth afterwards intangle their minds.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange overlaſhing when the Dr. ſaith that our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers dyed Martyrs for our Church. They dyed indeed for the Doctrine and Worſhip of our Church, as it is common to all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and grounded on the Word of God, in oppoſition to the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrv and Superſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and particularly that Idol of the Maſs. But the diſputable things of our Lyturgy as to Government Rites and Ceremonies, were never in queſtion then; nor did they bear any Teſtimony to them.

               <p>THE <hi>Dr</hi>'s Second Argument is taken from the Principles and Practiſe of the Old Non-Conformiſts, and largly proſecuted from §. 6 unto 17 ſhewing, <hi>That they condemned Separation from the Church of</hi> England; <hi>did not like of gathering ſeparate Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wrote earneſtly againſt the Separation of the</hi> Browniſts, <hi>and when ſilenced themſelves, pleaded for quiet ſubmiſſion, hoping that others might teach the people better then themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Anſ.</hi> An Argument from Authority and Example, eſpecially in a matter of practiſe as this is, is of great force, though not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, yet to induce mens mind to further conſideration of what they do, eſpecially when it hath been proved by reaſon before as farr as the nature of the thing will bear, but the <hi>Dr.</hi> having not given any direct argument either in his Sermon or this Book, to prove the Preaching of the Non-Conformiſts Unlawfull, which was the thing in queſtion, and from which I will not wander, the Judgment of former men is of much leſs weight when it is brought inſtead of Scripture and Reaſon, but we ſhall examine the force of it, ſuch as it is to remove the prejudice or Calumny that may be Created by it, though it be no argument; for what if the former Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts thought it unlawfull to preach, when ſilenced by Law,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97114:45"/>(which yet by the way they generally were not, but by the new impoſitions of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and the Canons of K. <hi>James</hi> which were not Law,) is it therefore certainly ſo indeed? what if they thought it unlawfull for them in their circumſtances, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unlawfull for us in our preſent caſe; or doth it follow that they would have thought it ſo, had they lived under the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? The circumſtances of every Generation vary things, and make many actions Lawfull or Unlawfull, expedient or not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, prudent or imprudent, and of this none but the perſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and concerned in them are competent Judges, Spectators can ſee but the outſide of things, Anceſtors know nothing of them; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they whoſe buſineſs and duty it is to conſider what they ought to do in the preſent caſe, are able throughly to judge what is meet for them to do or forbear. But the Old Non-Conformiſts direct all their Zeal againſt Separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it was practiſed by the <hi>Brownists,</hi> and what hence can be inferr'd againſt the preſent Non-Conformiſts Preaching the Reader muſt judge. For the further clearing of this matter, I will briefly conſider what were the general and avowed Principles of the old Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts in Eccleſiaſtical Matters, what was their practiſe, and what is peculiar in the preſent caſe beyond theirs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For their Principles,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Old Non-Conformiſts generally held the National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is Collected into one body under the Biſhops, as the general Heads and Spiritual Officers of it to be unlawfull, yea Antichriſtian, injurious to the ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations or Pariſhes, and contrary to the King's unqueſtionable Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. The Dr. Confeſſeth this of thoſe that preſented the Admonition to the Parliament 1570,<note place="margin">Part <hi>1</hi> Sect. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>viz,</hi> That they condemned the Government of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and that they diſliked the Miniſtry of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as ordained by, and derived from the Biſhops. Now this Admonition was written by Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> in the name and by the conſent of moſt Non-conformiſts then living. Doctor <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaith, that the Non-conformiſts in the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Church Hiſt. Cent. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> had a kind of Synod met in <hi>Coventry, Ann.</hi> 588, agreed upon divers things, as Canons, ſome whereof were, That Chriſt had appointed no Miniſters in his Church but Presbyters and Deacons, that the Biſhops pretending themſelves to be neither Presbyters nor
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97114:45"/>Deacons, but Officers diſtinct from them both, were no Miniſters of Chriſt, nor to be acknowledged as ſuch in his Church, and that none ought to receive Ordination from them, becauſe they Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not as Presbyters, but as Biſhops, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a power not derived from Chriſt. This and much more he took from Biſhop <hi>Bancroft.</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> the ſuppoſed Author of the Engliſh <hi>Puritaniſm</hi> delivers this,<note place="margin">Dang. poſit. Book <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> for the Judgment of the <hi>Puritans</hi> in thoſe dayes; <hi>They hold that there are not by any divine inſtitution in the word any ordinary National Provincial or Dioceſan Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,</hi>

                  <hi>or Miniſters under which the Paſtours of particular Congregations are to be ſubject as Inferiour Officers; and that if there were any ſuch, that when the word of God would have ſet them down mored iſtinctly, and preciſely then any of the reſt, for the higher place that one Occupies in the Church, of the more neceſſity he is to the Church, the more carefully would Chriſt the head of the Church have been in pointing him out, and diſtinguiſhing him from other, &amp;c.</hi> The ſame thing Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> layes down and proves as his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>There is a Treatiſe written in the Name of all the Non-conformiſts, directed to King <hi>james,</hi>

                  </note> called a Proteſtation of the King's Supremacy, wherein they ſay <hi>poſ.</hi> 27. <hi>We hold that theſe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical perſons that make claim to greater power and authority than this,</hi> (i. e. <hi>in particular Congregations as in the former poſition</hi>) <hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they that make claim</hi> jure Divino <hi>of power and Jurisdiction to meddle with other Churches then that one Congregation of which they are or ought to be members, do uſurp upon the Supremacy of the Civil Magiſtrate, who alone hath and ought to have</hi> (as we hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) <hi>a power over the ſeveral Congregations in his Dominions, and who alone ought by his Authority, not only to preſcribe Common Lawes and Canons of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, and conſent in Religion, and worſhip of God, unto them all, but alſo to puniſh the offences of the ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, that they ſhall commit againſt the Lawes of God, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of this Realm, and the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions Enacted by his Authority,</hi> and poſ. 28. <hi>We hold that the King ought not to give this Authority away, or to commit it to any Eccleſiaſtical perſon or perſons whatſoever, but ought himſelf to be as it were Arch-Biſhop and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Over-ſear of all the Churches within his Dominions, and ought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97114:46"/>under him his honourable Council, his Judges, Lieutenants,</hi> &amp;c. and Poſ. 32. They crave that the Biſhops may not be their Judges who were their profeſſed enemies, and tell the King that, <hi>So long as it ſhall pleaſe the King and Civil State to maintain in this Kingdom the State Hierarchy, or Prelacy, we can</hi> (in honour to his Majeſty and the State, and in deſire of peace) <hi>be content without envy to ſuffer them to enjoy their State and Dignity, and to live as brethren amongſt thoſe Miniſters that ſhall acknowledge ſpiritual homage unto their ſpiritual Lordſhips, paying unto them all temporal duties of Tenthes and ſuch like, yea and joyning with them in the ſervice and worſhip of God, ſo far as we may do it without our own particular communicating with them in thoſe humane Traditions and Rites that in our Conſciences we judge to be unlawful.</hi> Thus we ſee it was only for reſpect to the State, and for peace ſake, that they could give the Biſhops any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment or reverence, and that though they did acknowledge other Miniſters, for their brethren who did in Conſcience aſcribe ſpiritual Authority to the Biſhops, yet they did acknowledge the Biſhops as ſuch, neither for Fathers nor brethren.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Parker</hi> wrote in Latine <hi>de Eccleſiaſtica politia,</hi> wherein he proves Presbyters to be the only Miniſters, and anſwereth Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> where they maintain or excuſe Biſhops, or a power of impoſing what government the Magiſtrate pleaſeth upon the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They hold Congregations or Churches ſeverally to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goſpel Churches, and each one to have full power and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within it ſelf, without being ſubject to any Eccleſiaſtical Officers but their own; but all to be immediately ſubject to the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and his inſpection.</p>
               <p>This is the Scope of Mr. <hi>Baine's</hi> Dioceſan Tryal, of Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in his <hi>Medull. Theol. Cap.</hi> 32. <hi>Part.</hi> 1. And thus they joyntly declare,<note place="margin">Engl. puritan: Chap. <hi>3.</hi> part. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>they hold that the Paſtors of Particular Congregations are, or ought to be the higheſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Officers in the Church, over whom (by any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinance,) there is no Superiour Pastour, but only Jeſus Chriſt. And that they are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Antichriſt that Arrogate or take upon themſelves to be Paſtours of Paſtours;</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe poſition 2. before cited, And Poſition 3. <hi>They hold that if there were a Supream, National or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Miniſter or Paſtour, that ſhould be the Prince of Many thouſand Paſtors, that then alſo Chriſt (as he did in the Jewiſh Church)</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:97114:46"/>would have appointed a ſolemn National or Provincial <hi>Lyturgy</hi> or worſhip, unto which at ſometimes of the year, the whole body of the people ſhould aſcend, and that unto the Metropolitan City, as unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that he would (as he did in the Jewiſh Church) more preciſely and particularly have ſet down the manner of ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization thereof then of his Parochial worſhip. For as much therefore as they cannot read in the new Teſtament of any higher or more ſolemn worſhip, then of that which is to be performed in a particular Congregation, <hi>they cannot be perſwaded that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed any higher Miniſters of his ſervice and worſhip under the new Teſtament, then the Elect Miniſters of Particular Congregations,</hi> See Poſition 4th, more to the ſame purpoſe. And Proteſtation Poſition 24th, <hi>We confine and bound all Eccleſiaſtical power within the limits only of one particular Congregation, holding that the greateſt Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical power ought not to ſtretch beyond the ſame, and that it is an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of Princely Supremacy, for any Eccleſiaſtical perſon or perſons whatſoever, to take upon themſelves Eccleſiaſtical jurisdiction over many Churches, much more over whole Kingdoms aud Provinces of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They held that the Officers of every Church or Congregation, were Paſtors, teachers, and Elders, choſen out of the people, and herein they agreed with all the Proteſtant Churches beſides the <hi>Lutherans;</hi>

Poſition 1. <hi>They held That by Gods Ordinance the Congregation ſhould make choice of other officers as Aſſiſtants unto the Miniſters in the ſpiritual Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Congregation who are by Office joyntly with the Miniſters of the word, to be as Monitors and Overſeers of the Manners and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of all the Congregation, and one of another, that ſo every one may be more wary of their waies, and that the Paſtours and Doctors may better attend prayer and doctrine, and by their means, may be made better acquainted with the ſtate of the people, when other eyes beſides their own ſhall wake, and watch over them</hi> Proteſtation Poſition 25. <hi>We hold it utterly unlawful for any one Miniſter to take upon himſelf, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a ſole Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction over ſo much as one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore we hold that ſome of the ſufficienteſt and moſt honeſt and godly men in the Congregation ought to be choſen by the heads of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97114:47"/>to be adjoyned in Commiſſion as aſſiſtants to the Miniſter in the ſpiritual Regiment of the Souls of that Congregation of which he is the Paſtor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They hold that every Church hath power to Elect her own Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, &amp; to cenſure or depoſe them as they ſhal deſerve, and that this power ought not to be taken from them, though they grant alſo that the King or Supream Magiſtrate hath Authority to Command, and by Civil Mulcts to compel them to make due Elections, to amend undue ones, and ſo to cauſe them to reſtore ſuch Officers,<note place="margin">Engl. Purit. ch. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> as may be unjuſtly rejected by them, &amp;c. <hi>They hold that every eſtabliſhed Church ought</hi> (as a ſpecial Prerogative by which ſhe is endowed by Chriſt) <hi>to have power and liberty to elect and chuſe their own ſpiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Officers, and that it is a greater wrong to have any forced upon them againſt their wills, then if they ſhould force upon them wives, and upon women husbands againſt their will and liking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Poſition 6. <hi>They hold that if in this choice any particular Churches ſhall erre, that none upon earth but the Civil Magiſtrate hath power to controle or correct them for it, and that though it be not lawful for him to take away this power from them, yet when they or any of them ſhall apparently abuſe the ſame, he ſtands bound by the Law of God, and by vertue of his Office</hi> (grounded upon the ſame) <hi>to puniſh them ſeverly for it, and to force them under civil mulsts to make better choice,</hi> Proteſt. poſ. 26. <hi>We hold that theſe Eccleſiaſtical Officers being ſo choſen by the Church or congregation are to exerciſe over the ſaid congregation only a ſpiritual juriſdiction and power</hi> &amp;c. Then they ſhew the manner of proceeding in cenſuring private Members when they offend, and then adde, <hi>If any one of the Eccleſiaſtical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers themſelves ſhall ſin, he is ſubject to the cenſures of the reſt, as any other member of the Congregation, if they ſhall all ſin ſcandalouſly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the execution of their Office, or in any other ordinary manner, then the Congregation, that choſe themfreely, hath as free power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, and to place others in their room, if the Congregation ſhall erre either in chooſing or depoſing of her ſpiritual Officers, then hath the Civil Magiſtrate alone, power and authority to puniſh them for their fault, to compel them to better choice, or to defend againſt them thoſe officers that without juſt cauſes they ſhall depoſe or deprive,</hi> The ſame Doctrine is deſended by Dr. <hi>Ames Medul.

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. That it is Communicating with the Papiſts in Idolatrous and Superſtitious worſhip, eſpecially thoſe Papiſts that live amongſt us, and ſee how much we ſymbolize with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. Becauſe theſe Ceremonies are Sacraments of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. Becauſe they that uſe them do thereby acknowledge homage to an uſurped authority in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 12. Becauſe they are the occaſion of the damnation of great numbers, <hi>viz.</hi> the Papiſts who are hardened by them, and ignorant Proteſtants who place all their Religion in them; and becauſe the uſual excuſe for theſe and all other humane impoſitions (which the Dr. alſo makes frequent uſe of) is, that they are not impoſed as things neceſſary to Salvation, but as matters of Order, Decency and the like.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> draws his Eleventh Argument from hence, That the Ceremonies are therefore unlawfull, becauſe made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, which he proves, becauſe they are impoſed with greater Sanctions, looked after with greater Vigilance, and the neglect of them puniſhed with greater Penalties then many things neceſſary to Salvation are, and in all reſpects they are made equall with the moſt neceſſary things, the greateſt rewards being given, and promiſed to the obedient, even Heaven it ſelf, and the greateſt puniſhments inflicted and threatned againſt the diſobedient, Hell it ſelf not left out of the number. It was ſaid by one,<note place="margin">B. of Worceſt. Letter againſt Baxter.</note> that they do not puniſh the neglect of Ceremouies ſo heavily for the weight of the things themſelves, but for the breach of order, and the contempt of the Church, in ſuch diſobedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thus God himſelf puniſhing for the neglect or breach of any of his Poſitive Commands, doth not puniſh for the weight or moment of the thing, for he declares he values not Sacrifices, nor Offerings, but for Diſobedience to, and contempt of his Infinite Majeſty, and yet as he hath power to impoſe what he pleaſeth on his Creatures; ſo he hath that Infinite Wiſdom, and Goodneſs in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97114:49"/>his Nature, that inclines him to impoſe nothing but for good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the Creatures good; what power then will the Church arrogate to her ſelf? Beſides by this argument all offences againſt the State may be made Capital, becauſe they contemn the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates Authority, as well as all Offences in the Church, are or may be by this Doctrine made puniſhable with Excommunication, which depriving men of the ordinary means of Salvation doth what in them lies, caſt them to Hell. Nor can it be conceived by impartial men, that any Governours of the Church ſhould make thoſe things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and conſtant terms of their Communion from age to age, which they do in their Conſcience judge altogether indifferent, and of no neceſſity to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Non-Conformiſts deſired that they might be excuſed from the Lyturgy and Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they might have leave to Govern their own Churches according to that platform of Diſcipline that they ſhould draw up, and preſent to the King, and that they might not be compelled to Communicate with other Pariſhes in things they were not ſatisfied in, though they could own them for their Brethren, who practiſed thoſe things which they could not;<note place="margin">Proteſt. poſ. <hi>31.</hi>

                  <hi>All that we crave of his Majeſty and the State is, that by his and there permiſſion, and under their protection and approbation it may be Lawfull for us to ſerve and worſhiy God in all things according to his revealed will, and the manner of all other Reformed Proteſtant Churches that have made ſeparation from</hi> Rome, <hi>that we may not be forced againſt our Conſciences to ſtain and pollute the ſimple and ſincere Worſhip of God preſcribed in his Word with any humane Traditions and Rites whatſoever, but that in Divine Worſhip we may be actors only of thoſe things that may for matter or manner either in general or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al be concluded out of the word of God, alſo to this end, that it may be Lawfull for us to exhibit unto them, and unto their Cenſure, a true and ſincere confeſſion of our Faith, containing the main grounds of our Religion, unto which all other Doctrines are to be Conſonant, as alſo a form of Divine Worſhip and Eccleſiaſtical Government in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner warranted by the word, and to be obſerved of us all, under any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Puniſhment, that it ſhall pleaſe the ſaid Majeſty and State to inflict, vnder whoſe authority alone we deſire to exerciſe the ſame, and unto whoſe puniſhment alone we deſire to be ſubject, if we ſhall offend againſt any of theſe Laws and Canons that themſelves ſhall approve in manner aforeſaid, and our deſire is not to Worſhip God in Dark Corners, but

And we deſire we may be ſubject to no other Spiritual Lords but unto Chriſt, nor unto any other Temporal Lords, but unto themſelves, whom alone in this earth we deſire to make our Judges, and Supreame Governours, and overſeers, in all cauſes Eccleſiaſtical whatſoever, renouncing as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian all ſuch Eccleſiaſtical powers, as arroga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus much for their principles.</p>
               <p>From all which we may fairly inferr, 1. That the old Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts generally did not only allow of Separation from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its National Conſtitution, under Arch-Biſhops, and their Officers as lawful, but they did actually practiſe and maintain ſuch Separation. Foraſmuch as they declared the Hierarchy to be Antichriſtian, deragatory to Chriſts Government over his Church, contrary to the Conſtitution and Nature of the Church under the Goſpel, and alſo thought it inconſiſtent with the Kings neceſſary and immediate Supremacy over all Churches, and upon this account they inſiſted only upon their Pariſh Relations, accounting Pariſhes the only Churches, and the Miniſters of them the only Paſtors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they did generally live in Non-Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to the Ceremonies, and many parts of the Lyturgy. This is evident, becauſe they thought the Ceremonies
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97114:50"/>unlawful, and therefore though they continued in their Churches, yet none of them would uſe the Croſs in Baptiſm, few would wear the Surplice, none would compell the People to kneel at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and many gave it without kneeling, yea, many would not read the Common-Prayers, others but ſome pieces of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves either with Lectures without charge of a Pariſh, or elſe having thoſe under them that could read to do it for them. All their Care of peace which the Dr. now magnifies after their Death, but was in their life time as little accounted of, as ours at this day, they being alwaies charged with breaking the peace of the Church. I ſay, all their deſire of peace did not oblige them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with thoſe things which they thought unlawful, either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or at leaſt in their time and Circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I infer, That when they were rejected for Non-Conformity, they ſtill reckoned themſelves the rightful Paſtors of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and that their Right or Relation was not taken away, only that they were forcibly kept from the enjoyment of their right, and the diſcharge of the Duties of their Relation.</p>
               <p>And thus much appears from Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s Letter, cited by the Dr. giving the Reaſon why they muſt leave their People, and not Preach to them when deprived, becauſe this were to run upon the Sword of the Civil Magiſtrate, who would not ſuffer himſelf to be ſo deſpiſed, as that they whom he commanded to be ſilent, ſhould yet publickly preach in contradiction to his Command; there is nothing of fear of Schiſm in the caſe, but a prudent yielding to the times, and of two evils choſing the leſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> to do what good they could privately to their People and Neighbours, as their own words cited do ſhew, rather then by Preaching publickly to hazzard the bringing an open Perſecution upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their people.<note place="margin">p. <hi>1.</hi> Sec. Sect. <hi>16, 17.</hi>
                  </note> All that the Dr. hath quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let it be conſidered, it proves no more then this, that they did not think it prudence in their Time, and Circumſtances, to Preach publickly when ſilenced for fear of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Magiſtrate againſt them, and giving occaſion to thoſe that uſed to ſlander them, eſpecially to King <hi>James</hi> as Enemies to the Kings Supremacy; They alſo modeſtly added that the word might be Preached as well, yea, perhaps better by others, then by them; though their Pariſhes ſeldom found it ſo. All this was but a prudential Reaſon, proves no difference betwixt their Principles and Ours.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:97114:50"/>
               <p>Let us next conſider their practice, The Dr. tells us,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That the Old Non-Conformiſts thought it unlawful for private Perſons to endeavour Reformation of the Church, contrary to the will of the civil Magiſtrate, this he thinks condemns the practice of the preſent Non-Conformiſts. But Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> giveth another account of this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was reſolved amongſt the Non-Conformiſts after many years waiting,<note place="margin">Dang. poſit book <hi>3.</hi> chap. <hi>3.</hi> and chap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> and when they ſaw their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to the Parliament 1570 had no effect, that then they ſhould endeavour to reform each one in their own places, yet ſo as by all means to preſerve the peace of the Kingdom, which accordingly they did purſue in their ſeveral <hi>Synods,</hi> Claſſical, Provincial and National, from the year 1572 and forward, having at length compoſed a Book of Diſcipline <hi>Ann.</hi> 1583, which was reviſed by ſeveral <hi>Synods,</hi> and at length perfected, and according to it they did order themſelves, and frame their Congregations till all was diſcovered, and ſtopt by Arch Biſhop <hi>Whitgift:</hi> let us hear their own words.<note place="margin">Protest. poſ. <hi>30.</hi>

And this is all that the example of the Primitive Churches under Heathen Emperours doth prove; for they did keep their Aſſemblies and Worſhips in private, and maintain them to the death, againſt the Laws and will of thoſe Princes, but they did not ordinarily bring them into publick to affront the Magiſtrates to their faces, yet when they lived under mild Princes, and had a kind of tacite connivance they met publickly, as appears by the queſtion brought to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Severus</hi> by the <hi>Cooks</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> who laid claim to a publick Hall, which the Chriſtians uſed for their Worſhip, and the Mild Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour aſſigned it to the Chriſtians ſaying it was better that any God ſhould be worſhipped there, then that it ſhould be a place devoted to Exceſs and Riot,<note place="margin">Euſeb. eccl. hiſt Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Cap. <hi>1.2.</hi>

               <p>In Publick they held ſolemn meetings of Neighbour Miniſters, once in three weeks, which they called Propheſyings, wherein ſome prayed, others preached, or made Divinity Lectures. And Arch, Biſhop <hi>Grindal</hi> being commanded by the Queen to diſturb them, gave her a fair account of them, and refuſed to interrupt them, though he incurr'd her diſpleaſure for it, as may be ſeen in his petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> with all the former paſſages, <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover in all their Congregations they uſed the <hi>Liturgy</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own judgements, and omitted the Ceremonies as they thought fit; kneeling at the Sacrament was diſuſed, even at the Temple-Church, in the time of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Traverſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:97114:52"/>as appears by their Petitions annext to <hi>Hookers</hi> Eccleſ. Polity: Yea kneeling was not ſtrictly enjoyned all Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign. And Mr. <hi>Chadderton</hi> was blamed by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> at the <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>-Court Conference, for that in <hi>Emmanuel Coll.</hi> Chappel in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> many did not kneel, what they did in other parts of Church Government may be gueſt by this, that Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> enjoyned his own Man-Servant, being convict of Fornication, a form of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment which he gave him in writing, which was charged againſt him in the High Commiſſion-Court. Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> tells of a like inſtance of a man at <hi>North hampton</hi> Convict of the ſame offence, and how he was brought to ſubmiſſion and acknowledgment in the Congregation, and then abſolved by Mr. <hi>Snape.</hi> The Biſhop alſo gives account of their proceedings in their Claſſical Meetings, in their cenſures of their Brethren in the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>When the Canons were made, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1603, which were to thoſe Non-Conformiſts, as the late Act of Uniformity was to us, many were now turn'd out, and all liable to be ſo dealt with, but they that were ejected, ſtill accounted themſelves the Paſtors of their Flocks, though they were torn from them, and ſtill viſited them with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in perſon, Praying, Catechizing, expounding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to them in private, ſome were received into Gentlemens Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Preached publickly in their Chappels, others found favour under Biſhops of other Dioceſſe's, and got Livings with them; they joyned together in publick and private Faſts, they adminiſtred the Sacraments privately, they contracted and married many, being reſorted too from far, for the good and grave Counſel they uſe to give at ſuch times, ſome taught Schools, others bred up young men in their houſes for their Miniſtry, Mr. <hi>Bernard Gilpin</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> is noted by Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> for this, that he was wont to have twenty young Scholers at a time in his houſe; when they were to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained themſelves, ſome went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> others beyond the Seas, and got Ordination, which was not refuſed by thoſe Biſhops, and ſome they Ordained amongſt themſelves at home; and as the number of Non-Conformiſts increaſed, by the increaſe of new Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and more rigorous Proſecutions under the growing <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Faction in the Church, in the latter end of King <hi>James,</hi> and under Arch-Biſhop <hi>Lauds</hi> Government. So theſe practiſes of theirs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and they were bold in them as the neceſſity was greater, and that this was their practiſe, will farther appear by the late Act of Uniformity, the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act, and the Act againſt Conventicles,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97114:53"/>which do cautiouſly in particular provide againſt all ſuch things for the future, which the Contrivers of them would never have thought on, had not experience taught them that thoſe were the private practiſes of former Non-Conformiſts, when caſt out of their places.</p>
               <p>From all which, (which nothing but Ignorance can contradict it) it appears, that the old Non-Conformiſts, when ſilenc't and ejected by Law or Crnons, when forbidden by the magiſtrate and Biſhops, did not yet exerciſe all Miniſterial Acts and Offices, and did not count themſelves bound to be content with lay-Communion; they did them indeed in a way which they thought moſt proper to their Time and Circumſtances, and not ſo publickly as we do now; which is to be aſcribed to the difference of time and occaſions; which comes next to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>It muſt therefore be remembred, (having been ſpoken more largely before,) that for a good part of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Reign, Conformity was not urged with any ſtrictneſs, only Subſcription to the 39 <hi>Artic.</hi> and that too, moderate by the Statute of the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt two Succeſſive Arch-Biſhops, <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Grindal</hi> were mild and moderate men, who governed the Church about 25 years, and ſuch were moſt of the other Biſhops, having been Confeſſors and fellow-Sufferers with the Non-Conformiſts in the <hi>Marian</hi> daies: they had alſo travelled abroad amongſt other Churches, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were not ſo zealous in matters diſputable at home, of this we have a notable Teſtimonie from Mr. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> neither of them to the <hi>Non-Conformiſts.</hi> 
                  <q rend="margQuotes">At firſt the greateſt part of the Learned in the Land, were either eagerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or favourablr inclined that way, the Books then written, for the moſt part ſavoured of the Diſciplinary Stile, it ſounded every where in Pulpits, and in common Phraſe of mens Speech, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part began to fear they had taken a wrong courſe, many which impugned the Diſcipline, yet ſo impugned it, not as being the better form of Government; but as not being ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for our ſtate, in regard of dangerous innovations like to grow thereby, one man ſtood in the gap to oppoſe them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> which was Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> the following Brch-Biſhop; here was yet no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for their Preaching in private, while <hi>Whitgift</hi> was Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. The laſt 20 years of the Queen. the Non-Conformiſts were more ſtraitly dealt with, the Lyturgy and Subſcription more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly impoſed, their private aſſociations ſearched into, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97114:53"/>then were leſs then the little Finger to the loins, compared to thoſe of our days. The Non-Conformiſts yet enjoyed their places, at leaſt ſome places, as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> who was removed from being Profeſſor in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> yet was ſuffered quietly to Preach in an Hoſpital at <hi>Warwick</hi> till his death.</p>
               <p>After the making of the Canons 1603 the Non-conformiſts were turned out of places in greater numbers, but yet theſe Canons did not reach all, the matter being left to the Biſhops hands, ſome did either conuive at the ſecret omiſſion of ſubſcription, or at the doing of it in their own ſence, ſo that many either kept their old places, or quickly got new ones in other Dioceſſes. Beſides the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts were then but few in compariſon of the other Miniſters, and the people much fewer, who had not ſo much Religion as to make any difference betwixt Miniſters, and Preaching, and Diſcipline, or to diſtinguiſh betwixt the good and bad, nor were there yet any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of men going back again towards <hi>Rome,</hi> in Doctrine, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Ceremonies; and therefore thoſe Non-conformiſts might very well judge it was moſt advantagious to the Goſpel for them by quiet and private means to ſerve their people, then by appearing more publikely to occaſion greater contentions; but our caſe is far different. Till <hi>Whitgifts</hi> time there was hope that the acceptable things in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and Church Government might have been mended, their greateſt defenders judging this their beſt plea, as the forecited Mr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> in his Letter ſaith, that the Government of Biſhops was not unlawful, and ſetting up of Elders was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, or as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> expreſſeth it in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Arch-Biſhop (which alſo is the drift of his book) that there was no great harm if things complained of were ſtill continued in the Church, but <hi>Whitgift</hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>Bancroft,</hi> put an end to theſe hopes by eſtabliſhing all the things in queſtion by their Canons, and requiring all the Clergy to ſubſcribe to the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> but ſtill the Doctrine and worſhip was kept pure, and the bounds of our firſt Reformation maintained as ſacred, But Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> extended Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his new <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines, to his new Ceremonies, and to bring all men into ſuch ſubjection to himſelf under the name of the Church, that they muſt neither ſpeak nor do any thing in Religion but what he allowed and appointed, and now was hard to keep the ground which was gotten at the firſt Reformation. He and his deſigns were at length defeated, but civil broils hindred the ſettlement of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:97114:54"/>
               <p>At length when almoſt all men weary of confuſions longed for peace and union, the ſame <hi>Laudenſian Arminian</hi> Faction influenced the State, to eſtabliſh Conformity in an higher degree then ever, <hi>viz.</hi> that all Miniſters ſhould not only practiſe, but approve by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick declaration, all that was enjoyned in the Lyturgy, without any conſiderable amendment, hereupon there is no favour to be ſhewed to any, no moderation nor no end, all being eſtabliſhed by a Law, nor were they content to deprive the Non-conformiſts of their Churches, but a ſecond Law is added to drive them above five miles from thoſe that were there people, or any Corporation, where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being more civilized, and having more leiſure, might be more likely to hear then preach; and a third law alſo, that they ſhould not exerciſe any worſhip of God other then what is preſcribed by the Liturgy in any private houſe, or in their own family, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of five other perſons, ſo that the preſent Non-conformiſts is this. They are all turn'd out as one man, and that for no reaſon given, only things deviſed to be laid on them as ſnares which the impoſers knew they could not ſubmit to. They were in number about 2000. The People alſo of the ſame perſwaſion with them very numerous in the 3 Nations, and in <hi>Scotland</hi> the whole people, there was not ſo much as leave to Petition for any moderation, nor is there any bound of time put to this Rigour, nor may they be ſuffered privately, and in Corners to Act as Miniſters, and help their People, and in the mean while Popery Arminianiſm, Atheiſm, and prophaneſs break in like a torrent, now whether there is as much reaſon that the preſent Non-Conformiſts ſhould keep as private as the former did, the Reader muſt judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Dr. ſaith the old Non-Conformiſts earneſtly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Browniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And ſo do many of the preſent Non-Conformiſts alſo the <hi>Browniſts</hi> had two dangerous Poſitions or Principles peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That there was no true Church in <hi>England,</hi> nor indeed in the whole world, but that all Churches in reſpect of their Doctrine Worſhip, Ceremonies, Conſtitution and Order, or ſome of theſe were Idolatrous, and Antichriſtian, and that therefore no man that minded his Salvation ought to continue a member of them, or to hold Communion with them as Churches, though they might Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with particular Members, or with the Society as a Company of private men, Praying or otherwiſe Worſhipping God together,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97114:54"/>provided nothing was then uſed or done, which they diſliked.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Browniſts</hi> taught that the people had the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Government of the Church, and that the Miniſters, were but the Peoples Deputies in Preaching the Word, Adminiſtring the Sacraments, or exerciſing of Diſcipline, and muſt be accountable to them. Theſe Principles deſtructive of all Churches, the Non-Conformiſts earneſtly oppoſed, eſpecially the firſt, <hi>ſc.</hi> ſeparation from all the Reformed Churches, as Antichriſtian. For by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of this, they would prevent the other miſchiefs; but in maintaining the Churches of <hi>England</hi> to be true Churches, did they the Prelaticall, Nationall Church, in reſpect of the Eſtabliſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which themſelves had ſo often called Antichriſtian?</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt by their Books, and what is forequoted of their opinions, that they meant it of the ſeveral Pariſhes or Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>England,</hi> that they were true Churches, both in reſpect of their Conſtitution, and alſo in reſpect of their Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and that there was in them no ſuch intolerable corruptions, as that all Chriſtians ſhould fly from them; nevertheleſs when the Miniſters in particular Pariſhes were more then ordinary defective, and unprofitable, they allowed and encouraged the people to reſort to Neighbour Pariſhes for better means of edification; which Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> defends to be Lawful, Lect. upon <hi>John, Page</hi> 227.</p>
               <p>All this is the ſence of the preſent Non-Conformiſts; and I do verily believe there are no more <hi>Browniſts</hi> among the preſent Non-Conformiſts Miniſters, then there were amongſt them in thoſe days, for ſome there were then that went further then the reſt in Principles of Separation, and ſo it is in all times, and all matters of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and what conſiderable difference is there betwixt their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people to go to other Pariſhes or Gentlemens Chappels, and our allowing them to go to private Meetings, ſeeing one takes them off from their own Paſtor and Church as much as the other? The Dr. ſaith they ſtill kept the ſame Liturgy, and ſo they held Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the National Church, nay but many times they did not that; for ſome, the Old Puritan Preachers uſed it not in their Pariſhes or Chappels, others but little of it, others would Baptize without the Croſs, give the Sacrament without kneeling, Marry without the Ring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which made people reſort to them, who could not have ſuch Liberty at home, and ſo they varified from, if not omitted the Liturgy of the Church, but can a man be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the National Church of <hi>England</hi> and hold Communion with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97114:55"/>it, without being a Member of a particular Pariſh, and if they be allowed to continue members of their own Pariſhes, and not to make a Schiſm, who did in caſes of neceſſity, and <hi>pro tempore</hi> moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communicate with Neighbour Pariſhes, why may not the ſame be ſaid now, yea it is ſaid and beleived by moſt of the Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, that the Pariſhes are true Churches of Chriſt, and they do not ſeparate from them, or break off Memberſhip though <hi>pro tempere,</hi> and for the preſent neceſſity, they do ordinarily Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in private Meetings, where the ſame Doctrine and Worſhip is uſed, only ſome circumſtances and ceremonies omitted, but no contrary or new ones uſed in their room, or in oppoſition to thoſe in the Pariſhes, and thus much for the Old Non-Conformiſts, from whom I do not conceive thoſe that are now living do conſiderably differ in judgment or practiſe, but only as time and circumſtances do direct them, only they that are dead are out of the way, and ſo beſt ſpoken of, and they that are living, croſſing the humours or intereſts of their oppoſites are always ill ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. The Dr. next objects that we contradict the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Aſſembly of Divines, who did diſapprove and gave rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt the toleration deſired by the Congregational Brethren, as tending to endleſs Separation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Toleration deſired was, that all men ſhould have liberty to joyn with what Congregation and Paſtor they pleaſed without reſpect to Pariſh or place of abode, or any other civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution or ſettlement of men amongſt us. Their chief reaſons was that Chriſtians being not originally bound to Nations, places, or any other Civil Diſtribution, but left free to joyn with thoſe Congregations, that they ſhould find moſt convenient and edifying, and now Epiſcopal Government in <hi>England</hi> being diſſolved and no other ſet up in its room, the People were again free, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might make what Congregations or Societies they found moſt for their own edification, ſee Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Aſſembly thought not reaſonable, that things ſhould be unravelled into their firſt Principles, and that we ſhould begin to lay the Foundation of Churches again, ſeeing our Pariſhes, at leaſt thoſe that have good Miniſters, have all things neceſſary to a Church, and it is moſt convenient for Chriſtians Living in a Vicinity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Civil Officers to make the ſame Congregation for Worſhip, nor did they think, the former Relation of Pariſhes to be diſſolved by the diſſolution of the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> who were no eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97114:55"/>parts of the Pariſhes, but general Superviſors, or Viſitors over them, of the ſame mind are the moſt part of the Non-Conformiſts ſtill, and all the Congregational men went not that way, ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing all thoſe Pariſhes that had good Miniſters, and ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians fit for all acts of Church Communion to be true Churches. Mr. <hi>Cotten</hi> adds <hi>way of the Churches of</hi> New-England, that it is great preſumption to ſay that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was faulty in its firſt Conſtitution, and therefore to be pull'd to pieces, and new-built, ſeeing all Hiſtories agree that ſome of the Apoſtles, or Apoſtolical men, were the firſt Planters of the Goſpel in <hi>England,</hi> who did certainly conſtitute the Churches in a right manner. But where is the Conſequence to our purpoſe, that becauſe the Aſſembly, and we as well as they maintain that the Pariſhes of <hi>England</hi> are true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and not to be ſubverted, therefore when Thouſands of their Miniſters are violently thruſt out from them without any cauſe given, (and if they had been all caſt out as it was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſame) and their People left either deſolate, or like to be betrayed to Ignorance and Superſtition, that it were unlawful for theſe Miniſters to Preach to this People in Temporary Aſſemblies, or Congregations, till this ſtorm may happily blow over. I find no force in the Argument, but each Reader muſt judge for himſelf.</p>

               <p>THE Dr. ſpends the whole ſecond part of his Book in Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he ſaith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. The Principles of the preſent Separation, and thoſe are of two degrees.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Of ſome that hold no Communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> lawful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that hold only occaſional Communion with them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but not conſtant; and then proceeds to argue againſt Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Churches, whoſe Doctrine and Worſhip are for ſubſtance true,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97114:56"/>and good, and to ſhew many inconveniencies that will ariſe from ſuch Separation. Now though ſome of the Drs. Anſwerers have diverted to more general Queſtions about the Nature of Church Unity, Terms of Communion, and Cauſes of Separation, and its ſeveral degrees, and ſo have given him occaſion to follow them, yet I judge all this to be wide of our preſent Queſtion, in the ſence and apprehenſion of moſt Non-Conformiſts, for we are not diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about, much leſs erecting new Churches. The Queſtion only is, whether it be Schiſmatical and Unjuſtifiable for us to Preach and Exerciſe all Miniſterial Acts to the People in our Circumſtances, ſtill maintaining all the Peace and Communion we can, hoping in Gods due time this Wound of the Church may be healed. What further. Queſtions any particular Men have about the Conſtitution of Churches, belongs not to the Cauſe or Party of the Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, whoſe ſence he wrongfully aſcribes to Mr. <hi>A,</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> when they only ſpeak of General Queſtions about Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and not our particular Caſe in hand. All the Arguments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or force of this diſcourſe to our preſent purpoſe, lieth in this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Separation from Churches granted to be ſound in Doctrine and Worſhip, is ſinful, and in its effects very evil, but ſuch Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he would inſinuate, is the Non-Conformiſts Preaching, therefore ſinful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In Anſwer to this we ſay,
<list>
                     <item>(1.) That the Non-Conformiſts do diſclaim, and are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to own by this their Practiſe any Principle of Separation.</item>
                     <item>2. We ſhall ſhew wherein the great Evil of Separation li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And,</item>
                     <item>3. That the Dr. hath provided no better Remedy againſt it, then thoſe whom he oppoſeth.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Non-Conformiſts diſclaim Separation, for they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Pariſhes of <hi>England</hi> to be true Churches, and the Doctrine and Worſhip eſtabliſhed by Law amongſt them to be true and ſound; they acknowledge themſelves Members of thoſe <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> though wrongfully thruſt out, and evilly intreated by them. They did not Separate themſelves, nor withdraw from them, but firſt the Miniſters were caſt out by new deviſed terms impoſed on them, and afterwards many of the People were excommunicated (and more would have been, could the Pariſh Miniſters have had their wills) for non-communicating in doubtful, if not ſinful things.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:97114:56"/>
               <p>They are alſo ready and deſirous to return to a full union with the Pariſhes when ever the obſtacles ſhall be removed. And as they own no ſeparation, ſo their practiſe doth not conſtrain them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, They hold Communion with the Pariſhes, not only in Faith and Doctrine, but alſo in acts of worſhip, where they think they can lawfully do it, and when they are not imployed elſewhere. But the Dr. thinks if it be lawful for us to communicate occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſometimes with the Church we are bound to doe it alwayes, his reaſon is, becauſe if we be members of the Church, and the Church be in ſuch a condition, that we can ſometimes communicate with it, then we muſt do it upon all occaſions, or elſe we ſeparate and become members of a new Church; For Anſwer, I ſay, that there are many caſes wherein men ought to continue members of a Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> not totally to break off, but wait till abuſes may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and breaches healed, and yet it not be their duty to hold conſtant communion in all or any acts of publick worſhip; This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the inſtance of the ten Tribes after <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Apoſtacy, they were ſtill members of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and might not gather any other Church; there were many amongſt them who held Communion with <hi>Judah</hi> in Doctrine and Charity, but yet could not go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to all or any of the Feaſts or Sacrifices, which were there cheif Publick Worſhip. And that they ſinned not in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, appears, becauſe the eminent Prophets <hi>Elijah, Eliſha,</hi> and their Schollars, who were ſo numerous that <hi>Obadiah</hi> alone ſaved an hundred from <hi>Jezabels</hi> cruelty, and they had four Seminaries, or Colledges wherein they were bred up, theſe I ſay lived amongſt them, and kept private meetings with them, but neither went them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor required the people to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as things then ſtood, <hi>Hoſea</hi> blamed the Prieſts for laying ſnares and nets upon <hi>Mizpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor, Chap.</hi> 5.12. to entrap thoſe who out of zeal did go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thereby cauſed them to be put to death, but we do not find that this Prophet, or <hi>Jonas</hi> or <hi>Amos,</hi> who were all ſent to the ten Tribes, and preached to them, where they had opportunity, did ever preſs them to go up to all acts of Publick worſhip at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> becauſe they were Members of that Church.</p>
               <p>Again, the people of <hi>Judah,</hi> who lived nearer to the Temple, and had free acceſs to it when it was open, thoſe that were upright whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Prieſts or private perſons, went not up to it in the time of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Kings, when the Publick Worſhip was corrupted, yet they continued members of the Church; they frequented the Synagogues
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97114:57"/>or more private meetings at home, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.16. and waited ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many years, till Publick abuſes ſhould be redreſſed, I know it will be ſaid the caſe is not the ſame, Idolatry was here ſet up in Publick, and ſo it is not with us.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, The queſtion is not about the parrelling the caſe, but the truth of this propoſition, that where occaſional communion is lawful, conſtant is neceſſary, for here we ſee men continue mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Church, yea the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> continued officers in it, and the <hi>Prophets</hi> propheſied in it, and ſo held communion occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they could, and in thoſe things they could lawfully, but they did not communicate in all things, nor at all times, nor were bound to it. But let us go a little farther after the Captivity, the Jews being diſperſed through all Countreys, there continued, and ſet up their Synagogues and houſe of prayer where ever they could have leave. Thoſe Jews were ſtill members of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and yet did not, could not (the farre greateſt part of them) go up thither, They therefore held communion in ſome things, as the expounding the Law and prayer, but not in the <hi>Paſſover</hi> or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, which were their Sacraments, and the greateſt ties of their Society, and all this only for their Civil convenience, becauſe they were ſeated in other Countries, and by reaſon of Trade or other occaſions were loath to remove to Jewry; if this will excuſe them, why may not other Caſes ariſe where one part of a people may not think fit to break off from a Church wholly, and yet not be bound to all acts of Communion or worſhip with it, and ſuch a caſe we have frequently in Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory when the people of ſome great City, as <hi>Rome, Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> &amp;c. differ'd about chooſing a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the better and ſounder part choſe a fit and worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the bigger and worſe part choſe a Perſon unſound in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or ſcandalons in Life, and him they will have, thruſting out the fiter Perſon, and his People alſo, if they will adhere to him, what ſhould be done in this caſe. I know it was uſual, neither to Pray, nor hear together, though ſome of them might happen to be in the ſame Priſon, and in the ſame Room, but this without doubt was Schiſm on both ſides. Should the better yield to the worſe, and quit their Election. So they ſhould betray Religion and their own Souls; ſhould they quite break off, and forſake the others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving never to have more to do with them; So they ſhould betray the others to utter ruine, and the Church by degrees to deſtruction.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97114:57"/>The good Wheat continually-leaving the Tares, among whom yet it is very likely, ſome good Wheat may be ſcattered, it remains then that they keep to their Priviledge, and adhere to him whom they have choſen, and yet not diſſert them who would caſt them out, but communicate with them as Brethren, eſpecially in ſuch common Duties, as do not contain a plain acknowledgment of their undue and Schiſmatical practiſe, and ſo wait till Providence may find means to make up the Breach. That this is our caſe, ſhall be ſhewed in the laſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Dr's other reaſon is grounded from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. The ſum of his arguing from that Text is this;</p>
               <p>Men are to do all things Lawfull to maintain the Unity of the Church where they live, therefore whatſoever is Lawfull for them to Communicate in ſometimes, they muſt do it always.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Lawfull is either ſimply and abſolutely ſo, or Lawfull in thoſe Circumſtannces as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth betwixt lawful and expedient, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. <hi>i. e.</hi> lawful in it ſelf, or lawful in this or that caſe. If every man be bound to do all that is ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely lawful to preſerve the peace of the Church, then he may be many times bound to yield to turbulent and irregular perſons in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable demands and impoſitions, but if a man be bound only to do thoſe things which are lawful in the preſent Circumſtances, then the Argument is of no force, for it will be ſaid, they that held but occaſional and partial Communion; go as far as they judge lawful, <hi>i e.</hi> expedient and fit in their Caſe and Circumſtances, and ſo they ſhall not be bound to conſtant and full Communion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great ſin and miſchief of Separation lieth in judging and condemning others as no Churches, having no Miniſtry, no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo not being in the ordinary way of Salvation, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſts preſence amongſt them.</p>
               <p>This indeed deſerveth all the aggravations which the Dr. cites out of Mr. <hi>B. Sect.</hi> 24. and I am perſwaded he intended no more, and this was the meaning of the Old Non Conformiſts Severe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> viz. that they diſhonoured Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached his Servants, his gifts and Graces in them, and ſlandered the footſteps of his anointed. This indeed tends to the Subverſion of the Church, to expoſe it to the contempt of the world deſtroys all charity and brotherly Communion, and is a great preſumption, for who ſhall dare to judge when Chriſt hath forſaken a People, who ſhall profeſs his Name, and keep up his Worſhip for ſubſtance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97114:58"/>to his word, though they do, or are ſuppoſed to fail in Circumſtances, or leſſer parts of their Duty. And if the Fathers mentioned by the Dr. intended any other Separation by their high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt it, as it is probable they did not, (at leaſt thoſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, peaceable men, <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) when they ſaid Schiſm is as bad as Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may ſay by their leave, that they ſhew'd more zeal for themſelves and their own Intereſt, then for the honour of Chriſt, and the peace of his Church. Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> (tract of Schiſm) ſaith, Hereſie and Schiſm are the Theological Scare-Crows, wherewith Men fright Children, and men commonly uſe againſt all that differ from them, when they cannot prove ſuch a Crime againſt them, and again he ſaith the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> might have been in the right for any thing that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid againſt them; and if he had extended it to <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> writings againſt the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> he might perhaps not have exceeded the Truth. We do acknowledge all Un-neceſſary Separation from a Church is a ſin, let the ground be what it will, the errour of Conſcience in him, who thinks it a duty will not make it a duty, it doth impair Love, it lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church open to her Enemies reproaches, and to endleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions within her ſelf, but it is not ſuch a ſin as ſome men labour to make it to maintain their own greatneſs, as if it would excuſe men for the neglect of their Salvation, or make them amends for the loſs of Heaven, that they have been ſcrupelouſly fearful of running into Schiſm. Let the Church take care as Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> adviſeth, that the Terms of her Communion be no other then the Scripture will juſtifie, and do concern all Chriſtians; and if any other be added, let them be temporary, and removed when inconveniencies ariſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Reaſons for impoſing them, or equal to them. Let the Miniſters labour in publick and private with ſoft words and good Reaſons to ſatisfie the People in all their doubts about things relating to the Church, and if after all this ſome few (as they will not be many) are ſo far diſſatisfied, as that they they think they ought to withdraw, let them withdraw, provided they do not reproach and condemn the Church they depart from, and let them nevertheleſs be owned as Brethren. This certainly becomes the Goſpel, and will make more for the peace of the Church, and ſend more towards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of thoſe that ſeparate, then all corrections and hard words againſt Schiſm.</p>
               <p>And thus did the Primitive Chriſtians towards the <hi>Novatians,</hi> for though ſome zealous of their own authority ſpeak ſharply againſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97114:58"/>them, yet they were not troubled in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, the Biſhops of theirs ſate in the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> they had their publick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, one in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when it was the Imperial Seat, to which the people generally reſorted when <hi>Macedonius</hi> was Biſhop, and when their Church was commanded to be pull'd down, and they not to meet within the City the people aſſiſted in carrying the Materials, and ſetting up the Church in the Suburbs, yea, ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> the people would have been admitted into their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if the <hi>Novatians</hi> had been willing, and we may obſerve in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>Novatians</hi> never ceaſed till the clamours againſt them as dangerous and intollerable perſons were at end, and little or no notice were taken of them Indeed could it be proved that any particular Church under the Goſpel, whether National Dioceſan or Parochial was of the ſame conſtitution with the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that all Chriſtians were bound to be Members of it, or all that live within their Precinct, or at leaſt all that once have been Members, are indiſpenſably bound to continue ſo, then it were a damning ſin to ſeparate from them. But when it is Originally, as free for every Chriſtian to chooſe his Church, as to chooſe the place of his abode, and nothing but the convenience of his own edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the firſt place, and next the edification of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood obligeth him to joyn with, and to continue in this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, it can be no ſin of ſo high a nature, though it be blame-worthy for him to withdraw without juſt reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Say, that all Separation is as great a ſin as our Author would inſinuate, what means doth he preſcribe to prevent it? why, he ſaith all men are bound to do, and ſubmit to all things that are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to preſerve the peace, and to prevent the dividing of the Church. True all things that are really Lawfull, but not to all that the impoſers ſay are lawfull, if men muſt judge for themſelves, what is Lawfull abſolutely and what not, and what is Lawfull or not in their circumſtances, will not this open a door for Separation, as much as any thing his oppoſites have ſaid, he blames them for allowing people to ſeparate upon pretence of their Miniſters inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency or ſcandal, or interruption on them againiſt their wills, for doubtfull ceremonies for modes of Worſhip, for want of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or right Conſtitution of the Church, and ſaith (which is his moſt plauſible arguments,) that ſome of theſe, the Papiſts might have retorted upon our firſt Reformers, and all ſuch pretences would juſtifie the Ancient Schiſmes, and make way to endleſs Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97114:59"/>for the future. But he wrongs theſe Authors, which is a common ſhift, almoſt to all that write on this ſubject, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates that they allow Separation upon any pretence of ſuch cauſes. Is there no difference betwixt pretending and really proving the groſs inſufficiency, errours or ſcandals of a Miniſter, or groſs uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations over mens Conſciences and Liberty? do any prudent men allow Separation without good cauſe, full proof, all endeavours of amendment, patient waiting, and mature advice, and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all circumſtances? what then, is there no preventing endleſs Separation, but Tyranny over mens Conſciences, that they ſhall be compell'd to approve, and do whatſoever their Rulers pleaſe as the Papiſts teach? yes, the Dr's final determination is <hi>Page</hi> 208. <hi>A prudent and due ſubmiſſion in Lawfull things is a medium betwixt Tyranny over Mens Conſciences, and endleſs Separation,</hi> what is here more then any <hi>Browniſt</hi> will grant that underſtands himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that as Rulers muſt not Tyrannize over Mens Conſciences, ſo the people muſt not be given to endleſs Separation, and that the way to prevent both is, that the Rulers rule with due and prudent Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and that the people yield prudent and due ſubmiſſion, and that this Government and ſubmiſſion be exerciſed only in Lawfull things. But ſtill muſt not the people in ſubmitting as well as the Governours in Ruling, judge whether things be Lawfull or not? whether ſubmiſſion be due, and how farr, and in what caſes it is prudent to yield, or to deny it? if the people muſt not judge, then you eſtabliſh a Tyranny over their Conſciences, that they muſt approve what ever their Rulers command, or <hi>Hobbiſme</hi> that they muſt do what ever their Rulers command, though they beleive it to be ſinfull or inconvenient, if the people muſt judge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the things that concern them, then they muſt judge of the inſufficiency of their Miniſter, the Legallity of his call, and the like? but how then hath the Dr. put a ſtop to Separation more then they? may not men pretend things required to be unlawfull, ſubmiſſion not to be due nor prudent, and ſo without end? Their Arguments therefore are but Sophiſmes, like thoſe that plead againſt all certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſenſe or reaſon, becauſe many men are certain, <hi>i. e.</hi> confident when they are miſtaken, that a man cannot be ſure he ſeeth, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or feeleth, becauſe he hath many times thought he did ſo in his dream, when it was no ſuch thing, as there is a certain way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that men are awake and uſe their ſences, ſo there is as certain a way to prove by plain Scripture, when Miniſters are inſufficient,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97114:59"/>when impoſitions are unlawfull, when it is neceſſary to withſtand uſurpation on the Churches Priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what ever Sophiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will cavil againſt it, and if men will pretend cauſe of Separation when there is none or manifeſtly inſufficient, or but dubious, they may be convicted, and if they ſeparate, bear their blame: but whilſt men are ſubject to miſtake, to paſſion and partiallity, which will be till our Lord come, what ſhall put a ſtop to Separation but neceſſary moderation in Rulers in impoſing? one reverence in the people in ſubmitting, and meekneſs towards thoſe, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all care, weakly or peeviſhly may diſſent in things that are tolerable? This Learned man hath not ſhewed us, nor the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Fifteen Hundred Years, the Popiſh Cruelty could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Separations, Epiſcopal Authority could not prevent them. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Novatians</hi> had their Biſhops, impoſing Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Ceremonies could not, the Firſt Diviſion in the Chriſtian Church roſe about the keeping of <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> if people offend againſt the plain Rule of Scripture, or the plain Rule of good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order, let them be puniſhed according to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, but not for things doubtfull in Scripture, or burthenſome in Government, if men offend in leſſer matters, and cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, let them be born with till inconvenience be ſeen to ariſe from ſuch Clemency, and then it is time enough to retract or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench it; if this were not dayly done in Nations and Families, no Civil Society could ſtand, how then ſhall the contrary ſeverity eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj:</hi> The Dr. objects, the Reformers taught, that where there is ſoundneſs in Doctrine and Worſhip people ought not to ſeparate from a Church for leſſer defects, real or apparent, and that they inſiſted on the corruption of Doctrine and Worſhip, as the only cauſe of their Separation from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Doctrine and Worſhip are indeed the chief things in a Church, for if God be truly worſhipped and his knowledge be truly taught, mens lives will be bettered, and their Souls ſaved by it, but then it muſt not lye dead in the Confeſſion of Faith, and in the Lyturgy, while men preach falſe Doctrine, and bring Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions into the publick worſhip, or elſe neither Preach nor Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in the Congregation at all, or ſo ſeldom that the people can be little profited by them, the Reformers never thought of this myſtery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not true that they ſeparated from <hi>Rome</hi> only, for the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97114:60"/>Corruptions of Doctrine and Worſhip, it was for ſuch Corruptions hat they counted her Antichriſtian a Rotten and Apoſtate Church, with whom they might have no Church Communion, but her uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Tyranny over all other Churches was uſed alſo as an argument for our withdrawing from her, for if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have no Authority over all, or any other Churches, and if the exerciſe of ſuch power be an inſufferable oppreſſion, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Churches, then they might juſtly upon this account caſt off her Yoak, though for this alone they ſhould not reject Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her as a Neighbour Church. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> Dr. <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal</hi> and others of late inſiſt upon this as the chief defence of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> becauſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> was for the firſt 600 years independent on her never Subject to her, but Dr. <hi>Reynolds conference with Hart,</hi> and all other of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers who wrote againſt the Popes Supremacy, made this one Argument to juſtifie their ſeceſſion, and ſo it will be in leſſer caſes, even a juſt ground of departure from conſtant Communion, though not a ground of refuſing Brotherly and occaſional Communion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be corruptions in Doctrines and Worſhip allowed alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The firſt Reformers generally, except <hi>Calvin,</hi> were too ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent both of Worſhip and Diſcipline, being wholly intent upon reforming the Doctrine of the Church, groſs Idolatry indeed in Worſhiping the Maſs, Saints and Angels they did quickly eſpy, but Images in Churches with other Superſtitions, Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies they took little notice of, to cauſe them to be reformed, and hence the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to this day retain them, as if they were approved of by <hi>Luther</hi> and his Companions: perhaps they waited that the Princes ſhould reform theſe things, or it may be they thought if they could have liberty to Preach ſound Doctrine, that would of it ſelf purge out theſe diſorders in worſhip and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they alſo might think the people, and eſpecially the Princes would yet ſcarce bear ſtrict Diſcipline, but in time might be brought to it, but they found they were miſtaken, and ſome of them ſaw their errour while they lived, <hi>Bucer Oelochampadius</hi> and others complained as <hi>Comconius</hi> hath cited them in his Exhortation, that they had not ſet up Diſcipline at firſt, for now the people had got Knowledge and Notions, and were uſed to Liberty, they would not bear the Yoak of Diſcipline, <hi>Bucer</hi> with Tears ſaid to ſome <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi> when he had read their Confeſſion and former Diſcipline, <hi>vos ſoli habetis regnum Chriſti interris,</hi> none but you have the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97114:60"/>of Chriſt on Earth. In like manner do the beſt <hi>Helvetians</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> complain in every Age of want of Diſcipline and Power in their Churches.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſame Synod alſo declares that Ceremonies ought not to be impoſed, and when they had recommended kneeling at the Sacrament to their People, to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Socinians</hi> that lived amongſt them, they add that they would not enjoyn it, for if they ſhould, then they might be neceſſitated to uſe the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Cenſures againſt thoſe who would not ſubmit, which ought not to be uſed for Rites and Ceremonies.

               <p>Ceremonies many times pollute the Worſhip of Chriſt, and he forbad Iſrael all the Rites and Cuſtomes of the Heathen, as well as their Idols and their Worſhip, but if the Ceremonies themſelves be really inoffenſive, yet the uſurpation of them that impoſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority, may be a greater offence then the Ceremonies impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and juſtly to be reſiſted, and if they will maintain their Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a diviſion, this breach muſt be upon them.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He means the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> for whom our <hi>Arminian</hi> Church men have ſome kindneſs, but little for other Proteſtants, yet this will not follow, for a Chriſtian may ſubmit to thoſe Rights and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in another Church where he occaſionally is, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with them but as Brethren, which he may not do in his own Church, where he is a conſtant member, and ſo is guilty of the Corruptions, which according to his place he doth not oppoſe, even as every prudent man complies with the Orders and Cuſtomes of places and Families; he goes in abroad, though he will not ſuffer the ſame to be practiſed in his own houſe, but alas what hope of Union with Proteſtant Churches, when we teach, that where there are no <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops, there are no Churches, no Miniſtry, no Sacraments, ſome of his Majeſties Chaplains when they were with him in <hi>Paris,</hi> did hold no Communion with the <hi>French</hi> Churches, as they complained in publick Letters, to ſay nothing of many at home, that kept their own houſes 12 years or more, during the late troubles; going to no Church for want of Biſhops, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, finally our Act of Uniformity decrees. That no man ſhall Preach or Adminiſter the Lords Supper, much leſs have any Eccleſiaſtical Preferment that is not Epiſcopally Ordained, beſides all other Subſcriptions. Now the Communion of Churches lieth in admitting of Miniſters to officiate in each others Churches ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as well as in admitting the People to lay-Communion, as in the famous inſtance of <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> celebrating the Sacrament together, Let us unite at home, and then there may be hope we ſhall unite with our Neighbours.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The grounds of the Non-Conformiſts preſent practiſes.</head>
               <p>THE Dr. ſpends the whole <hi>3d.</hi> part of his Book in confuting the Pleas for Separation from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Churches, which I ſhall leave to thoſe whom it concerns, and ſhall only ſay, that all theſe diſputes do really increaſe, and not hinder Separation, by laying open the firſt Principles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the People, and filling their heads with Notions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes about things, whereof they are not competent Judges: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in Governing, and not diſputes about Governments doth moſt diſpoſe the People to Obedience and quiet Submiſſion, and as in Commonwealths, when People have not the Protection of their Governours, or the Benefit of their Laws and juſt Priviledges, rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings diſpoſe them to defection, and to ſtudy Arguments to defend it from the natural principles of ſelf-preſervation, and the peoples intereſt in all Government by their Primitive conſent to it, and their ſucceſſive approbation of it: So, rigorous Impoſitions in the Church, without any condeſcention in Governours, upon juſt complaints, will at laſt make the People weary of forbearing, and ſearch for all pleas, whereby they may defend themſelves in ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Yoke; and then it will little avail their Rulers, either to their profit, honour or peace of their Conſciences, to cry out upon Rebellion or Schiſm when they have loſt the people: Our preſent practiſe in Preaching, though ejected and forbidden, is not grounded on, nor need be ſupported by theſe, or any other pleas for Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; The general ſence of the Non-Conformiſts, both Miniſters and People, (leaving to particular Perſons their particular ſentiments as the Church of <hi>England</hi> alſo doth to many of her Members,) is this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Pariſhes of <hi>England</hi> generally are true Churches, both as to the matter of them, the People being Chriſtians, and not to be excluded from Church-Communion; and as to the form of them, their Miniſters being true Miniſters, ſuch as for their Doctrine or manners do not deſerve to be degraded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Doctrine, Worſhip and Sacraments in theſe Pariſhes are for ſubſtance ſound and wholeſome, though there are ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97114:62"/>things mixed in them, and annexed to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they are ſtill Members of theſe Pariſhes; the people of thoſe where they live, and the Miniſters ſo far, as not to be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet up diſtinct and permanent Churches; nevertheleſs they think themſelves bound to joyn together for the Worſhip of God according to their own Conſciences, and publick allowance for ſome years paſt; deſiring and waiting for an opportunity to return fully to the Pariſh-Communion, when ever it ſhall pleaſe their Rulers to condeſcend to their reaſonable requeſt, in relaxing or removing thoſe things which are ſo offenſive to them; and in this their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe they judge they do no more then the Primitive Churches often did, when erroneous, or otherwiſe unfit Paſtours were obtruded on them, or other differences aroſe amongſt them, whereupon the Congregations were often divided, as in <hi>Rome, Antioch, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with divers other places, and then when thoſe offences and differences were removed, they returned to full eommunion again; or as did the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when by, <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> Apoſtacy they could not go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with ſafety, or other times could not communicate there, becauſe of Corruptions under ſome Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> who then held private Aſſemblies for the preſent neceſſity, and when all obſtacles were removed, again went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even many of the Ten Tribes in <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s time, when their own Idolatrous Princes were remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they could do it without danger, though they were ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Idolatrous Conquerors, but ſuch who lived remote, and gave them more Liberty of Religion then their own Princes did.</p>
               <p>We judge our caſe to be like a caſe of neceſſary ſelf defence, where preſent neceſſity is the Guide and Law-giver, and ordinary Laws and orders which are proper for times of peace, are in a great meaſure ſuperſedent. When a Kingdom is invaded, or divided within it ſelf, all things threaten ruine; it is lawful for the people to gather into ſeveral Bodies, to poſſeſs Garriſons, to choſe them Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and for fit men to undertake their conduct, though without, though contrary to ſome preſent commands that may be unduly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and given, yet they ſhall incur no guilt of Sedition nor Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſo long, as they deſign nothing but the preſervation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the whole as far as they can, and are ready to return to their own places ſo ſoon as peace ſhall give them leave.</p>
               <p>When an Army is in danger to be betrayed by the falſehood or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the principal Officers, or when it hath loſt its Generals in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97114:62"/>ſome defeat, it would not be accounted mutiny for the Soldiers to run together as they can, and with the help of inferiour Officers to preſerve themſelves from being ſold or deſtroyed, provided they ſtill retain a reſolution of returning to the Body of the Army, when they may with ſafety to the whole, and to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus the Non-Conformiſts lie under ſuch a neceſſity, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for the Reaſons laid down in the former part, <hi>ch.</hi> 6, and 7. which it may not be amiſs for a concluſion briefly to ſum up.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is now no reaſon to be pretended for the impoſed Conformity:</hi> In K. <hi>Edw.</hi> dayes, the Biſhops, their Clergy and People made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to retain what was then retained, <hi>now</hi> 'tis not ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired. In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days there was hopes of winning of the Papiſts by our moderation, <hi>now</hi> there is none, but more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their incroaching upon us by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Diſſenters from this Conformity were heretofore but few, now they are a very conſiderable part of the Church;</hi> I will make no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. Formerly the Miniſters were generally cenſured as <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and were but few, the people likewiſe but two or three in a great Town, now they are Multitudes, and thoſe who are zealous for Conformity, appear fewer then thoſe, who would be glad to have it reproved, at leaſt in all places that are moſt civilized.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conformity hath occaſioned a woful Diviſion and Scandal in our Church ever ſince the Reformation, and therefore ought not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo much Experience of the evil of it, and alſo after plain evidence of benefit and advantage to Religion, by the removal of it for ſome years, to have been again ſo rigorouſly enjoyned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The things in Queſtion, though not of the higheſt nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet by occaſion of the Diviſion they cauſe at home, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Papiſts make of it have endangered our whole Religion, and will do, ſo long as they are continued.</hi> The Nation will not forget the alteration of Doctrine, and of the Lyturgie, innovations in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and additions of Ceremonies that were brought in by Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> under the pretence of Uniformity, decency, and oppoſing the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> till matters were brought to that paſs, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts wanted nothing to encourage their hopes of ſwallowing us up, but the proſpect of a Popiſh Succeſſor to the Crown; and his own Chaplains and dependents were not aſhamed to profeſs, that there was a deſign of Reconciliation with <hi>Rome;</hi> and whether the preſent growth of Popery and Confidence that the Papiſts are arrived to, had not its Riſe from the Act of Uniformity, its turning out ſo many
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97114:63"/>Miniſters, and making ſo great a breach amongſt our ſelves, and whether it be not ſtill fomented chiefly by our diviſion, and under pretence of zeal againſt Diſſenters, let unprejudiced men judge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A great part of the Nation both Miniſters and People have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves and their poſterity to the long deſired Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that not without authority, though not with full autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So great a number of Miniſters and Students were caſt out by the Act of Uniformity, that cannot but for one age at leaſt, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endanger the Church, which muſt needs be ſupplied with young ignorant and unlearned perſons, or be unprovided, the Univerſities being not able in many years to furniſh out ſuch a number of tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſters, as were ejected, and the viſible effects do confirm this.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Terms of Uniformity are moſt rigorous and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for not only all was enjoyned, that had been complained of 100 years and upwards, but alſo others added, ſo manifeſtly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to inſnare and offend thoſe that were concerned, that nothing could be more.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There was no hope left either of alteration of this Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or of relaxation in the execution of it, it being eſtabliſhed by Law, and the Biſhops made the Overſeers of the execution. It was alſo corroborated by two other ſubſequent acts, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miniſters from being of any uſe, yea from living amongſt or near their people. And to this againſt the Miniſters was added, that none of the ſame ſnares were put upon the people, all that bore office, civil or military, that ſo there might be no relief for the preſent, and no hope of redreſs for the future.</p>
               <p>Now ſhould all this be quietly ſubmitted to, there would be no end of impoſition on the Church, ſeeing Rulers might when ever they pleaſed throw out both their Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and they muſt all quietly ſuffer whatever they will impoſe on them. We may add, there had been as patient forbearance, and as peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means for redreſs, during a 100 years, as ever was in any Church, inſomuch as we are now upbraided with it, but nothing was obtained at laſt, but adding to their Burthens, and that not without ſcorn and indignity; and that the blame may not be caſt on our Princes, on whom our adverſaries injuriouſly, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully, for the moſt part caſt it, 'tis not to be forgot, what at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and endeavours his Majeſty made at his entrance on his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to moderate and accommodate things in the Church, both
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97114:63"/>by his declarations, and granting a Commiſſion to a fit number on both ſides, to review the Liturgy, and to endeavour a compoſure; but the Commiſſioners for the Church would never vouchſafe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal conference, and debate with the Non-Conformiſts about the things they deſired to be amended; and the Anſwers they returned in writing were ſcarce with common Civility; but once in all their replies, giving them the Title of <hi>Brethren,</hi> and at laſt yielding to amend nothing conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe accounts the Non-Conformiſts judge it their duty to help the diſtreſſed and oppreſſed people what they can, whilſt they live, praying and waiting that peace and order may at length be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to theſe Churches, and verily believing that if theſe impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be continued, they will unhinge and divide the people, that ſcarce any time or means will reduce them to due order, and then even we may be counted honeſt men when we are dead, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in reſpect of thoſe that come after.</p>
